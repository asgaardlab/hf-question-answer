contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I tried running the tts server (v.0.2 and v.0.1) locally using an RTX 4090 graphics card, but getting a Pytorch error related to the architecture.  I believe the RTX 4090 (Ada Lovelace) needs CUDA 11.8 or later - and a corresponding Pytorch version.    Anything I can to do make it work?
