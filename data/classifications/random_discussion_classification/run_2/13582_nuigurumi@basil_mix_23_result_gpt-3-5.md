contains_question: yes

question_part: Firstly, I would like to inquire about your definition of a "derivative" for basil-mix:
- If a model is finetuned from basil-mix, to what extent does it qualify as a derivative? I presume you might use metrics such as SVD distance to assess "similarity."
- If a model is partially merged with basil-mix, what percentage of incorporation would classify it as a derivative? For instance, would you consider OrangeMix to fall within the scope of your derivative, thus prohibiting commercial use?

Furthermore, I am curious about the implications of the license change for existing models/products/illustrations created before the change:
- Are fanbox owners required to remove previously published works in light of the new license terms?
- Must published or printed AI artworks be revoked to comply with the updated license?
- Do heavily human-modified artworks or i2i'ed images count as creations of your model? Can your model be utilized as an intermediate step in the creation process without being subject to licensing terms?

Finally, I would like to address the validity of the license:
- Does the license provide me with a guarantee that you will support me in the event of any copyright infringement claims arising from the use of your model?
- Are there any copyrighted materials utilized as training data for the model, which you do not own and that could potentially pose issues if I were to use your model commercially?
- If I purchase a license from you for $1,000 per month, would I be able to distribute another model similar to yours under a free distribution license, while maintaining compliance with your licensing terms?
