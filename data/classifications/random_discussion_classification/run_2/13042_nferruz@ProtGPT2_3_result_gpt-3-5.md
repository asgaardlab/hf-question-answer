contains_question: yes
question_part: Is it possible to fine-tune ProtGPT2 for a mutation generation task (input-output pairs, more like question-answering in tasks terminology) where given a sequence it would return a mutated sequence. And I'll fine-tune it on this kind of a dataset with input-output pairs of wild-type & mutated sequence? If yes, then could you please guide me with how this kind of input-output sequence mutation generation could be performed with ProtGPT2?
