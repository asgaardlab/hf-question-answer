contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- Firstly, I would like to inquire about your definition of a "derivative" for basil-mix:
- Are fanbox owners required to remove previously published works in light of the new license terms?
- Must published or printed AI artworks be revoked to comply with the updated license?
- Do heavily human-modified artworks or i2i'ed images count as creations of your model? Can your model be utilized as an intermediate step in the creation process without being subject to licensing terms?
- Does the license provide me with a guarantee that you will support me in the event of any copyright infringement claims arising from the use of your model?
- Are there any copyrighted materials utilized as training data for the model, which you do not own and that could potentially pose issues if I were to use your model commercially?
- If I purchase a license from you for $1,000 per month, would I be able to distribute another model similar to yours under a free distribution license, while maintaining compliance with your licensing terms?
