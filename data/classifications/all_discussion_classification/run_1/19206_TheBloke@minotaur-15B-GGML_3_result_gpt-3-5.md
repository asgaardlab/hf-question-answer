contains_question: yes

question_part: Getting this to run in Ooba? Anyone know what settings I have to choose? It seems Ooba got some updates talking about Minotaur 8K? But I can't get either the GPTQ or GGML versions of this model to run in Ooba even after update? I can get up to 65B models to run so it's not a VRAM or RAM issue? Any ideas? Or is this model still not supported? Or special setup steps?
