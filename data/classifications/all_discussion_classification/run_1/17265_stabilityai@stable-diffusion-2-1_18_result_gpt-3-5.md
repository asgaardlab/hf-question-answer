contains_question: yes
question_part: Can you release a list of all images that were filtered out of the LAION dataset? Is it possible to access a list of all of the images that were censored from the original LAION dataset (i.e. the SAMPLE_ID for each censored image), for those of us whose tender eyes will not be harmed by NSFW imagery? If it is not available currently, would the devs be willing to make it available?
