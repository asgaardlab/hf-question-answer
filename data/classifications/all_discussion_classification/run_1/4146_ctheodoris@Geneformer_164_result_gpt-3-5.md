contains_question: yes

question_part: After running isp.perturb_data, I got two pickle files: in_silico_delete_perturbed__dict_1Kbatch0_raw.pickle and in_silico_delete_perturbed__dict_1Kbatch-1_raw.pickle. I found a similar discussion regarding this issue before but didn't get the point of how to solve this issue. I reinstalled the latest version of Geneformer but still got this error. Could you help me with this? Thank you very much!
