question_part: hello! i wanted to contact you to ask some questions about how you created this model, but couldn't find a way to communicate to you directly. i hope using the community tab is an alright method to do so. what data did you use when training this model? where/how did you train it? how much data did you use? did you directly take audio from videos, and if so, how did you clean up the audio?
