contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- **Endpoint Testing Failure:** To further investigate, I utilized the 'Test your endpoint!' feature within the Hugging Face platform by dragging and dropping an image directly. Unfortunately, this also resulted in the same error message.
  
- 1. What is the correct way to structure the request for the Inference Endpoint when using image URLs?
- 2. Is there a step I might be overlooking that would account for the difference in behavior between the Interface API and the Inference Endpoint?
- 3. Has anyone successfully used the Inference Endpoint with image URLs, and if so, could you share an example request?
