contains_question: yes
question_part: Can we get some sample scripts please? I have scripts that use the llava-hf version of the models because they have examples but this repository doesn't have any...it can be in either the straight transformers library or the pipeline feature...Also, any nuances like whether bitsandbytes can be used along with it would be GREAT!
