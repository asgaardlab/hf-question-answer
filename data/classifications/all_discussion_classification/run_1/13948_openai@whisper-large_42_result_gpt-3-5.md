contains_question: yes

question_part: I have a question here: I want to integrate OpenAI Whisper into an offline system. How often OpenAI will release Whisper, is there the release plan or roadmap? Will be the project stable or can be abandoned at some point? What can be the price for commercial offline LLM?
