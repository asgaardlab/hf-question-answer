contains_question: yes

question_part: When I attempted to directly convert it into a .loom file and then use TranscriptomeTokenizer to convert it into a .dataset, I found that the resulting .arrow file is not usable. Could you please provide a detailed description of the required attributes for generating a .loom file or provide an example of the conversion?
