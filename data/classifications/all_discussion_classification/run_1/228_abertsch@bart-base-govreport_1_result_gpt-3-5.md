contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi! I used the model finetuned on the Gov-Report training dataset in this repository to evaluate the RUGUE-2 on validation and test datasets. However, I have not reached the reported results of Table 3 in the paper, 15.3% vs 19.6%. I have found a solution https://github.com/abertsch72/unlimiformer/issues/17, but it still needs to fine-tune the fine-tuned model. I am confused.
