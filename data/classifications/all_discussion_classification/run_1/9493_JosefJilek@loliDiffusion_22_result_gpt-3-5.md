contains_question: yes  
question_part: I've checked all the files in the Examples directory and noticed you didn't provide examples for 4 of the new models: loliDiffusionV0.11.10_AOM3-A2_1.0M4-CLIP_VAE_PURIFIED.safetensors loliDiffusionV0.11.10_AOM3-A3_1.0M4-CLIP_VAE_PURIFIED.safetensors loliDiffusionV0.11.10_Animelike2D-v2_1.0M4-CLIP_VAE_PURIFIED.safetensors loliDiffusionV0.11.10_MeinaPastelV6_1.0M4-CLIP_VAE_PURIFIED.safetensors There are a lot of checkpoints here, so having examples would help in deciding which ones to get. And I always prefer to use one of the original generation examples as the cover image. So it would be nice if you could provide at least one for each of those. Thanks
