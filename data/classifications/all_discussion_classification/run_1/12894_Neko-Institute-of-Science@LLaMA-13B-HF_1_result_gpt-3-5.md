contains_question: yes

question_part: Some claim that the weights have to be reconverted from Meta weights. More so, the textgen webui has now an extra download functionality for new tokenizers, which overwrite the ones from this repo, if I get it right. It seems, one has to reconvert from Meta weights to derive weights one can fine-tune upon.
