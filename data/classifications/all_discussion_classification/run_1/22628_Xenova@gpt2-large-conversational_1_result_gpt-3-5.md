contains_question: yes

question_part: I have this error when I run this code : Error: Exception during initialization: D:\a\_work\1\s\onnxruntime\core\optimizer\initializer.cc:31 onnxruntime::Initializer::Initializer !model_path.IsEmpty() was false. model_path must not be empty. Ensure that a path is provided when the model is created or loaded. am I, missing something?
