contains_question: yes

question_part: I know your data sets are proprietary, but you mentioned that it contains both offensive and defensive training material.  Do you provide training data that covers forensics, etc, for the defensive side or is it more (hate to use this term) biased towards offensive tooling like metasploit, and those toolsets, for example?
