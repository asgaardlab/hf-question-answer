contains_question: yes
question_part: Does the GPT4All (windows version) already support mpt-30b-chat? I would like to use this model using GPT4All and id like to know does GPT4All (windows version) already support mpt-30b-chat? Do you have any other alternative to run this model on Windows OS? I would like to use this same model not the quantized versions (GGML) . What is your suggestion for running it on Windows?
