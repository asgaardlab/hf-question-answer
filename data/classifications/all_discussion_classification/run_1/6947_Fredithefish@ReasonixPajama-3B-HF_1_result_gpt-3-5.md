question_part: 
Just curious, does the training dataset includes the truthfulqa dataset which is being used during evaluation for Open LLM LB?
If so, is it still fair to use truthfulqa as a metric to evaluate this model? Because compared with other 3B, (or maybe 65B/70B) models, the truthfulqa metric is very high.
