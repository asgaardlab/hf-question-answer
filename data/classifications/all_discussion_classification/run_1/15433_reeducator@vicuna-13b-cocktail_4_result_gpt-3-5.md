contains_question: yes

question_part: Sorry Triton VS Cuda what is the difference? 
I don't really need an in depth answer but I tried to google it and nothing made sense to me. Is the Triton model better for Oobabooga? 
Act order is an improvement on how the USER and AI talk? Like were it will stop less or answer it's own questions less or something no that I have there issues at present? 
Here is my current argument if I run the Triton model that has these new functions should I change my arguments?
