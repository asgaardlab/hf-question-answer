contains_question: yes

question_part: 
I found that pytorch_model-00001-of-0000?.bin files are not found. Should I download those files?
If pytorch_model.bin.index.json needs to be edited, please let me know how to do, because this file has 410 lines, I guess just substituting with 4bit-128g.safetensors or 4bit.safetensors will not work.
