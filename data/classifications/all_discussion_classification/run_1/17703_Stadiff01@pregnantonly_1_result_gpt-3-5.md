contains_question: yes

question_part: I don't recognize pregnantonly, its not anywhere on civitai. What are the trigger words? I used  <lora:pregnantonly:1> at various strengths, along with the words pregnant, and hyperpreg, but I didn't notice anything different. Can you explain exactly what the model is? I assume its pregnancy related.
