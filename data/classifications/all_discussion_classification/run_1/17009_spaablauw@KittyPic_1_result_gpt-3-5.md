contains_question: yes
question_part: From what I gather, embeddings like these are specific to either SD1 or SD2 does that mean I can only use them on top of an SD 2.X model? is it specific to a certain resolution, like a 512-based model vs a 768 one? also I see one says one filename saying it is 1000 steps and the other says nothing. so which one do I pick is the one with no steps mentioned the better or lesser one?
