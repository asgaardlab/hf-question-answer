contains_question: yes

question_part: If I understood well StarCodeBase and StarCoder are two different models. When I go to https://huggingface.co/chat/ I see the notice "BigCode/StarCoder is now available Switch model", When I click the switch model StarCoder isn't in the list. The only two options are StartCoderBase and OpenAssistant/oasst-sft-6-llama-30b. How can I start using the new model?
