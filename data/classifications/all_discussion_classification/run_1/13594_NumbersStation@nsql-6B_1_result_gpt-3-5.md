contains_question: yes

question_part: Is there a way to provide columns description in the prompt
Models like gpt3 or gpt3.5 allows to provide column name and description in the prompt. like (tablename({col1:col1description, col2:col2description})) is there a way to do this in nsql prompt. It is very useful incases where column name are not generic and description can provide more meaning to it. Most of the questions ask in generic english. it not necessary to be the exact column name. So is it possible in Nsql models?
