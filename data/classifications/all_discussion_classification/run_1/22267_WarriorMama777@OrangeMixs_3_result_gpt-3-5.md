contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Which VAE is the model capable of using?
This might be a dumb question or something weird happening on my end, but which VAE models are compatible?
I've downloaded a couple of them (namely the anythingV3 ones) and they won't even show up in the list. But whenever I switch back to some other model, they work fine.
