contains_question: yes
question_part: Do your .ckpt model weight files have /unet/diffusion_pytorch_model.bin in them?
I'm new to the .ckpt file format, but based on the above, are they some sort of compressed file format that has directories in them, e.g. `unet`?
Do you know if the issue is with the OpenMMLab package mmedit, or with the .ckpt files?
