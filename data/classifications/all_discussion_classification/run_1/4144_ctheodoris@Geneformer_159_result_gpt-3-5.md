contains_question: yes  
question_part: I just wanted to check that I can use the cardiomyocyte dataset.arrow format for the perturbation example provided? Also, what is output_prefix that is needed to be provided within the code? Will you be adding any example codes to visualise the perturbation examples like you have with the cell embeddings? Could you also provide an example loom file that you have used so that I can check its structure against mine if possible?
