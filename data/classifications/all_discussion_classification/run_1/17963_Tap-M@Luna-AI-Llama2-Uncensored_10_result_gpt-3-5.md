contains_question: yes
question_part: I asked an innocuous question about who was Alan Harper's ex-wife on Two and a Half Men and it gave me attitude about respecting the private lives of celebrities.  Curious, since this didn't happen with the original Llama, I went online and found out Meta pre-censored the model so it can't be uncensored. And if you ask about if this or that celebrity hooked up it won't have an answer even though it's common knowledge and answered by even unfiltered Llama 1.
