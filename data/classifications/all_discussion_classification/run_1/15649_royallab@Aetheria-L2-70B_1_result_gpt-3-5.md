contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm wondering if you've tested this with the GOAT model's storytelling prompt format, or even if you've used both at the same time, or some sort of chimerical prompt. Merging limarpv3 with that model is an intriguing idea. I haven't actually tried GOAT's accompanying code on github, have you? If so, did you try it with this model? Just curious.
