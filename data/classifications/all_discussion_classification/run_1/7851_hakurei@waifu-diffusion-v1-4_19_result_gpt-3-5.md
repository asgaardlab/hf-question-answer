contains_question: yes
question_part: Is wd-1-4-anime_e1 ready for for training or otherwise general use, or should I stick to one of 1.3's checkpoints (f32 pruned, f32 full + opt, etc.)?
question_part: Will different checkpoints be available for this version as there are with 1.3? Or will the current checkpoint be enough for both general use and training?
