contains_question: yes

question_part: As the error says "You seem to have cloned a repository without having git-lfs installed. Please install git-lfs and run `git lfs install` followed by `git lfs pull` in the folder you cloned." And when I tried to do this by what it said, it pops up that "cannot resolve <HEAD>", so is there any way to solve this?
