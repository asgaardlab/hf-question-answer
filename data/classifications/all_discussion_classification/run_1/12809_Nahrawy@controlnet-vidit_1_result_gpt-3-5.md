contains_question: yes

question_part: Can you share more information into how to use it. I saw the prompts but needed more understanding on how to use it with more than one controlnet. There are two parameters other than prompts, but I fully didn't get what to make sense of them. Also, since it is from Inpainting model v1.5, is it possible to not specify the lighting at all and get the controlnet to auto generate perfect lighting?
