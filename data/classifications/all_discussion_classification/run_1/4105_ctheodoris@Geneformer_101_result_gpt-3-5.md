contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. How did you perturb 4 genes (OSKM)? Does combos function allow for 4 perturbations at once or did you need to use one of the factors as an anchor gene?
2. For the anchor_gene function, I tried using ensembl id for various genes (in a format shown below), but getting an error. Can you please double check to see if there is anything wrong with my parameters?
3. How many cells did you need to model to get statistical significance for OSKM reprogramming reported in the paper?
4. For some genes (like SOX2), I'm getting extremely low N_detections in the dataset (3 cells out of 1000). Could you please explain why that would be when I'm using an "overexpress" function and if there is any way to increase it?
