contains_question: yes

question_part: Can you incorporate madlad400 training data ?
I j ust wondered, given the flawless grammar it produces, maybe the trainind dataset would be a good addition to your LeoLM model.
Or maybe a pure llama based translation model could be created, fine tuned on translation into german (or all languages like madlad appears to handle)
