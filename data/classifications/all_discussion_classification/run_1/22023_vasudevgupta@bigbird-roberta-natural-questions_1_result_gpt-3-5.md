contains_question: yes

question_part: Does anyone know if this is expected behavior?  I have the same warning with `BigBirdForQuestionAnswering`.  I would expect the exact same output layers as the model checkpoint when initializing the model this way.  If there is a change that must be made to use the checkpoint, would someone be willing to share?
