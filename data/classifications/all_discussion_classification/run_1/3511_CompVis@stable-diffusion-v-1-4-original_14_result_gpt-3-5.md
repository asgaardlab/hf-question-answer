question_part: RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory
Is there a way to work around this issue?
RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1024.00 MiB (GPU 0; 6.00 GiB total capacity; 4.54 GiB already allocated; 0 bytes free; 4.66 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.
