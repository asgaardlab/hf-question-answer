contains_question: yes

question_part: Sometime I wonder if it isn't leaking some Salesforce application code.  I spent 4 years working there and am familiar with it especially when I see embedded SQL in hello work program.  Also I see text being displayed only to be overwritten in the output window.  I doubt if that is a bug in the GUI but your model is likely generating control char's or escape sequences.
