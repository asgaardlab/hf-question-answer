contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi, will you be including all of your code in order to replicate your analyses from your paper for validation purposes and to understand the technical work better? Also, I may be misunderstanding here but you do not include all of the code/data needed to replicate your examples. For example, for the dosage sensitivity test there's no gene_train_data.dataset that's needed as the training dataset. Or for the bivalent chromatin section, you've given the data but not the code used for the analysis. Any help on getting the model up and running would be appreciated thanks.
