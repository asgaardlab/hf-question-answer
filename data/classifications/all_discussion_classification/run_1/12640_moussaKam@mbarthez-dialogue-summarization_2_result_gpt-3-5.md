contains_question: yes
question_part: Could you tell me the specific dataset that you used for the finetuning?
 Also, did you initiate your training with the basic mBarthez model, or did you instead start with a version of mBarthez that had already been trained on the OrangeSum Abstract dataset?
 Thank you for your time!
