contains_question: yes
question_part: But alas, playing with the HF space https://huggingface.co/spaces/aruntruminds/thenlper-gte-large I noticed the same results. What could be going wrong? I've actually noticed this behavior in other embedding models as well, and I have never seen an model give a negative similarity score, which is also counterintuitive since two sentences could actually be semantically opposite.
