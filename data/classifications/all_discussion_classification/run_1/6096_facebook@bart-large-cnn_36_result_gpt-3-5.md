question_part: What can I do to make the model hallucinate less?  I am using this model to summarize news articles. It works great most of the time. But it tends to hallucinate information quite a bit. How do I solve that issue? Will fine-tuning with more data help? or adjusting the parameters like num_beams temperature top_k top_p repetition_penalty
