contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I'm currently trying to get the vicuna-13B-1.1-GPTQ-4bit-128g model working on my PC. I'm using a Windows 10 computer and I'm also using Ooba. I've downloaded the repository including the  no-act-order version as I have an Nvidia GPU (RTX 3070), but when I type in the chat, my message briefly shows for about a second and then disappears. It seems the only model that works for me is the "TheBloke_vicuna-AlekseyKorshuk-7B-GPTQ-4bit-128g" version.
