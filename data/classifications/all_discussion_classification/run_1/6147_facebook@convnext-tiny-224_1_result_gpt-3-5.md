contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi! I have been using the ConvNext models available on Hugging Face now with success, but I would like to try out some of the other pre-trained models (convnext-small-384-22k-1k for example) that are available on the ConvNext repo. What's the process for converting the .pth files to the .bin files that we see here?
