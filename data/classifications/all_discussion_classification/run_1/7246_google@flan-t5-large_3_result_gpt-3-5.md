contains_question: yes

question_part: Failed to reproduce results with chain-of-thought prompting on MMLU even using the prompts provided by the paper (prompts can be found at https://github.com/jasonwei20/flan-2). On more than 10 tasks I randomly chose, I got lower accuracies than reported, e.g., on the philosophy task, the reported accuracy is 55.9%, while I got 50.0%. In fact, I also failed to reproduce results using direct prompting.
