contains_question: yes

question_part: I want ask however about the reason for the very high number of iterations used in the example images and that it is seemingly required to produce results of that same quality. Why is the high number of steps needed, and are there any adjustments or strategies one can employ to produce the intended result of this model at a lower number of steps?
