contains_question: yes

question_part: torch.cuda.OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1024.00 MiB. GPU 0 has a total capacty of 8.00 GiB of which 0 bytes is free. Of the allocated memory 6.11 GiB is allocated by PyTorch, and 451.52 MiB is reserved by PyTorch but unallocated. If reserved but unallocated memory is large try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation.  See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF

Any suggestions?
