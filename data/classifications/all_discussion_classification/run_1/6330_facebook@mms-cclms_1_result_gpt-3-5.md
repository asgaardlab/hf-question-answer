question_part: Originally I thought this was an issue with git / git lfs on my end, so I viewed and downloaded a couple lexicon.txt files from huggingface online - but each of the ones I viewed still appear to be symbolic links that point to locations I don't recognize (presumably, they are pointing to file locations on the machine that this repo was originally uploaded from).
