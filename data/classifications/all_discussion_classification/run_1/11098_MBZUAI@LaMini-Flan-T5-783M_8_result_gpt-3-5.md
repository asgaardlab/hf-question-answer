contains_question: yes
question_part: Is there any official doc which tells whats the supported maximum output length from this model? 
I believe FLAN's output length is capped to 512 and BERT's 1024? Is this even correct? 
If so, is there any option to increase this limit to generate longer paragraphs using this model?
