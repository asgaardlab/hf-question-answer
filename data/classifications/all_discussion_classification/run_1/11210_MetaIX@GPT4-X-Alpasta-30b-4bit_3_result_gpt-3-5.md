question_part: Best optimized settings for 24GB VRAM video card? As title, I am currently running RTX 3090 24GB, but this model exhaust my VRAM after 10-15 lines of prompt, is there any other setting should I change to optimize the balance between VRAM consumption and performance? Really enjoyed this model but sadly I can't really get the most out of it because of out of memory errors.
