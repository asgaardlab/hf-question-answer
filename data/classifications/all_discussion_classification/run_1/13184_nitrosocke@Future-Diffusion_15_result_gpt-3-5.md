contains_question: yes

question_part: I've been trying for Future-Diffusion for about an hour, I'm having some outputs with double objects in the image,  as you can see in the following matrix with 3 samplers and steps, I can see a lot of images with on car on top of each other, or overlapping each other, sometimes the wheels duplicated. 
Is this normal? is the prompt causing this problem? any suggestions?
