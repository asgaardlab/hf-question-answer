contains_question: yes
question_part: A quick question on the MQA architecture: I understand that it is a great impl. for inference. However, is there a way to convert existing MHA checkpoints into MQA-based ones? Given that the cost of retraining models is quite high, it would be nice if there's a way to convert MHA model weights to MQA ones.
