contains_question: yes  
question_part: I would like to ask if I can run some of your models with 6k tokens or 8k tokens even without using Exllama with my 16 vram and my 32 gigabytes of ram in windows 10 with my AMD graphics card, in the event that it is required in a mandatory way use Exllama, can you tell me if there is any way to make it work, are you working on a version that works in windows for AMD
