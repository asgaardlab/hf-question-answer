contains_question: yes

question_part: I was wondering if you have any suggestions for fine-tuning the model on real perturbation data, is the current architecture suitable for simultaneous training on control and perturbed, or alternatively do you suggest computing features from each condition separately and build a model on top of that, or maybe any other ideas.
