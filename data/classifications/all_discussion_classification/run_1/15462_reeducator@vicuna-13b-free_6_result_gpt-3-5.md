contains_question: yes

question_part: When I try to use .safetensors model file with oobabooga, it says I'm missing config.json, and probably all the other files like tokenizer.model that usually come along. Can I use these from the older vicuna-13b-4bit-128g model that anon8231489123 released before, or do I need new ones specifically for this model, and where do I get them?
