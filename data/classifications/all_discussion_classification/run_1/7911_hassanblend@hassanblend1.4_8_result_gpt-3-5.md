contains_question: yes

question_part: Sorry to ask it here but on Hassan site it says that I need to "HassansBlend1.4 - new as primary, CandyMissionBerryF222-Hassan as secondary" but I can't find the second one. Do I still need it for better results or main Hassan model + vae is enough? And If I need it, what are the proportions?
