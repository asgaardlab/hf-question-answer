contains_question: yes

question_part: where I can find which params are accepted  for model.generate(...) function if model is defined as model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained(base_model).to(device) (here device is "cuda") Is there any docs that I could check? Basically I need to know if I can tell to the model the "temperature" I want to use and how many "results" I want on the output
