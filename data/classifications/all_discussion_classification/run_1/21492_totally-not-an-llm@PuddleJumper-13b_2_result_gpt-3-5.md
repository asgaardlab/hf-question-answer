contains_question: yes
question_part: Which specific adapter was merged into the original model? I'd assumed it to be https://huggingface.co/totally-not-an-llm/EverythingLM-13b-V2-peft, but found the `max_position_embeddings` had been left at 4096. Any details for this (potentially unreleased) adapter?
