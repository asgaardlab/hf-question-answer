contains_question: yes

question_part: i'm interested to know the cost of such fine-tuning processes, of course i'm aware that the cost is related to many factors (model size, dataset size, hardware etc) but would love to hear an estimation for a specific case and then i believe i can adapt it to my configuration in order to have an estimated cost.
