contains_question: yes

question_part:
1. Do you plan to make the dataset public? If not, would it be possible to make public at least small portion of it, to see how similar dataset could be modeled in different languages?
2. Could you provide some details on training procedure? Hyper-parameters and you HW setup + total time it took you to finish training?
