contains_question: yes

question_part: Unfortunately on my setup I get an error message saying I do not have the yaml file linked to the brightness model and that it causes an error in activating it. Do you need to instal controlnet 2.1 for it to work? Where can I find this YAML file. Please add it to your files?
