contains_question: yes

question_part: it is super super SLOW
the SDXL DPO takes more than twice that of vaniala sdxl (using the sample script from the card: diffusers pytorch on nvidia/cuda)
Results are not really better than vanila sdxl
sd1.5 DPO is probably slightly slower than vanila sd15
Quality of the results are rather debatable.
