contains_question: yes
question_part: Would it be possible to implement other types of comparisons, while keeping the prompt and other settings constant? Like model x VAE, model x sampling method, or now with ControlNet, model x ControlNet model? Or VAE x sampling method, and so forth. It would be incredibly useful for finding out which combinations work best.
