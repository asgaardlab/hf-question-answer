contains_question: yes
question_part: This time i got this error:
```
Error: <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?> <Error><Code>RequestTimeout</Code><Message>Your socket connection to the server was not read from or written to within the timeout period. Idle connections will be closed.
```

Is this because my internet connection keeps disconnecting, or is it something else?
