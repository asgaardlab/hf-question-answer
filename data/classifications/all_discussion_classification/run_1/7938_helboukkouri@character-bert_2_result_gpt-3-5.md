contains_question: yes

question_part: However, I still cannot figure out how to pass output from the tokenizer to the model. More precisely I can't return outputs from the tokenizer as pytorch tensors, because they have mismatched length (due to special symbols). Do you have any idea how to use this model within the HuggingFace framework?
