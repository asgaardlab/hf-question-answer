contains_question: yes
question_part: Can we control the language of generated queries in the mT5 model? For eg. if I have an input document in English language, can I generate the queries in Hindi in the zero-shot setting using mT5 (i.e. there is no train data for English-Hindi document-queries)? Basically, the aim would be to limit the vocabulary of the mt5 output sequence to a specific language, wdyt?
