contains_question: yes

question_part: Was reading the documentation and noticed this disclaimer.

Isn't the whole POINT of a license to make some sort of Copyright legal claim that you have the necessary rights to license out a model, and are engaging in a legally binding activity?

AFAIK, a license is a legal document. So of course it's not legal "advice", but it is legally binding ðŸ˜…. 

But from my perspective, the Apache 2.0 license was never applied to this model, because you never included the Apache 2.0 license inside this repo. That seems to be a requisite for the Apache 2.0 license, or specifying exactly what part of the repo is under Apache 2.0 using very specific formatting. 

Since you did neither, I don't think anyone could really claim this model was ever under apache-2.0. I know this is not a "norm" on HuggingFace (but it IS a norm on Github), and might seem trivial, but to me it is significant. 

At best, you have "tagged" the model with Apache 2.0 in the HuggingFace system, and written in a readme that it is (but using the wrong formatting), so that hardly seems like a legally binding act.

Just my 2 cents, since you seem to have dug yourself into a bit of a bind of desiring to license correctly, but think you're not able to.
