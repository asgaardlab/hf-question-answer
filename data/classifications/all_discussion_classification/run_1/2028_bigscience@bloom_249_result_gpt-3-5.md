contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm working a project that involves generating and validating IP claims.  Is Bloom a good choice for this type of generation/understanding project? Is there a better choice (of LLM)? Can anyone link to a good survey / guide that spells out why to chose one over the other for this type of job? And a guide or Colab project showing how to use Bloom with LangChain for something like this.
