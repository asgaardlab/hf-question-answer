contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. Can LCM (https://huggingface.co/Linaqruf/lcm-lora-sdxl-rank1) be used with version 3.0 of Animagine?
2. After loading the model, is it possible to toggle the activation of LCM on and off each time the generation function is executed (as shown below)?
3. If I want to enable both LCM and LoRA (https://huggingface.co/collections/Linaqruf/animagine-xl-lora-656323c28fb38d71f76be91e) for generation, are there any specific considerations to keep in mind?
4. What code is required to use the Upscaler as seen in your demo?
