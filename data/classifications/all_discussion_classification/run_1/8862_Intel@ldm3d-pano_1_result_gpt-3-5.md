question_part: 
First, I followed the guidance of ldm3d huggingface space and generated some panoramas images. but I found that the performace of panoramas generated by ldm3d-pano checkpoints is not as good as that in the demo(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hbUo-hwAs0). In the generated settings, the height is 1024, the width is 2048, and the prompt text is "360 view of a beautiful garden in CG style", use default values for other parameters. However, the result style is not CG style and geometric deformation is serious. Could you tell me some suggestions about generating better quality panoramas?
