contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I'm using the TF implementation and I want to know if there's a way to constrain the vocabulary size to the common 20 amino acids but without using my own config class, I mean by loading the pre-trained weights. Also, I don't understand what are the additional characters in the vocabulary list.
