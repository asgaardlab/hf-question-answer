contains_question: yes

question_part: My problem is, the resultant mask generated is not outputted by the generator, and is only shown as a temporary inlined image within the ControlNet annotator panel. I want to be able to save a full batch of 300+ of these depth map frames from a video, so it is too time consuming to load each frame and generate and save each annotator result. I'd like to be able to batch save each annotator image result as its generated - can anyone help?
