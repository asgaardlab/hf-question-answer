contains_question: yes

question_part: I noticed that you have proposed "selecting 2048 genes in an unbiased way from the initial bulk RNAseq to present to the model, for example by intersecting with genes detected in that cell type in usual single cell RNAseq data." in a previous similar discussion https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/discussions/134. May I use a similar way such as intersecting genes using scRNA-seq data from adjacent tissue sections as an alternative strategy?
