contains_question: yes

question_part: I consider this concerning as this reddit post is written by Weyaxi, the producers of one of the models you've claimed to use in your merge (Weyaxi/OpenHermes-2.5-neural-chat-v3-3-Slerp), and the model that you've claimed, that apparently has identical weights was produced by this same individual previously (Weyaxi/Seraph-7B), but was coincidentally omitted from all the testing you've described in your blog post.
