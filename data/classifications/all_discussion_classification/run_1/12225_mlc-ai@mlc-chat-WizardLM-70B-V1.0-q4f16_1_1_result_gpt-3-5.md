contains_question: yes

question_part: Any chance you could do more uncensored 13b models? Like Doctor-Shotgun/CalliopeDS-L2-13B or even just Guanaco-13B-Uncensored or WizardLM-1.0-Uncensored-Llama2-13b? Apparently this thing is fast, but I can't get collab conversion running (maybe I'm just dumb), and the models you offer by default aren't the best, you know? People running local models often want either a) uncensored assistant or b) roleplay
