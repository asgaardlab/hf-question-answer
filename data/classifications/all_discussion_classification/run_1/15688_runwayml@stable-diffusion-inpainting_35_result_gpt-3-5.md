contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm not sure why, but the inpainted section of my photos frequently (and sporadically) produce this "noise" in the image. I have tried adjusting all the settings to various levels, switching models, vae, and nothing seems to fix it. I haven't been able to find this issue anywhere else. Has anyone else had this happen
