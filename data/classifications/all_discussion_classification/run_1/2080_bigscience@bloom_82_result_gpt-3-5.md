question_part: How to use Bloom InferenceApi with Colab ?  When i was searching i found that repo created by 'Sentdex' (https://github.com/Sentdex/BLOOM_Examples/blob/main/BLOOM_api_example.ipynb) But I want to know how to do more customization, such as multi-class text classification and not just text generation example. Or I want to know how to Fine tune with this API?
