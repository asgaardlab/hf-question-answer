question_part: Is it possible de perform Speaker Embedding with Whisper ? For example, encode a few seconds of audio (a speaker) to a vector, encode a second audio file with another speaker and get the "distance" (cosine similarity for example) between two voices (or between voice of same speaker), thanks you
