contains_question: yes

question_part: When I want to translate an english text to turkish, sometimes the text is cut off in the middle of the sentence, or last sentences are missing altogether. Sometimes it translates only the first sentence and don't bother with the rest. Approximately 5% of the translations are like this. Is there anything I am missing? Even when I copy/paste the sample code, the error is there (or using the space in the page)
