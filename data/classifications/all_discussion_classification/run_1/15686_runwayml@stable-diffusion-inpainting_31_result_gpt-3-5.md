contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. The region where the dog is removed is missing details and is blurred but also and other parts of the bench are blurred, making it looking "artificial". I don't know if this is the purpose  - to change the entire picture not only what is under the mask?. Usually inpaint is understood as filling in only the region under the mask?
2. Please make it to work consistently - when empty text is provided object has to be just removed (inpaint). It would be nice to show and some text prompts - for example why when I type  "red bricks" it is not working? I should be able to display all text prompts and images with text containing the word "bricks".  Otherwise how to make it know that I want just to fill in the hole in the bricks wall with the same bricks wall already on the picture? It is confusing.....
