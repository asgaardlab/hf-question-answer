contains_question: yes

question_part: On the machine I am working on I can't use AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(), because it gives an Exception: "error: no locks available". This is a local problem on my side, but I am wondering if there is an alternative way to instantiate the tokenizer, like an OPTTokenizer class.
