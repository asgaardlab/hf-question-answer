contains_question: yes

question_part: - Will you support the SDXL TI's soon ?
While there are not many yet, I've been in a journey in training TI's for 1.5 with decent success,  so I'd like to dive into it !
I see there is "TextEncoder" and "TextEncoder2", I hope those added TI will fit into the smallest :D

- Maybe you got some progress at Reference controlnet ?  It may stops the training/dreambooth once for all, idk :)

- I'm not on Sonoma Beta, I'm curious about your experience with the compressions, How long are those compressions ? have you tried to go lower than 6bits ? 
On Apple's HF repo there is (only?) about 570MB difference from 16bits to 6bits I was hoping to have 1:1, 2:3, 3:2 for the storage of a single old model, are my expectations too high ?
