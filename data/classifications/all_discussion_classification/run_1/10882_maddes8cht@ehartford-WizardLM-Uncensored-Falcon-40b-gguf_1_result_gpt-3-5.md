contains_question: yes
question_part: "BTW, if you ever feel fit to do any "lightweight" models (e.g. just a couple billion parameters), that would be appreciated.  :)  They're nice to use as a base for training new, highly-specialized models. You could even just take a heavyweight model and strip out deep layers then retrain for a bit - I've seen this done with a (non-open) model and it worked well."
