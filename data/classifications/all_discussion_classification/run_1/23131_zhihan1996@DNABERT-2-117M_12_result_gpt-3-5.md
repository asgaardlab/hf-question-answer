contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, 
Can you please share the env or the versions of the main packages used for running DNABERT2? (python version, pytorch, transformers, triton etc)
I saw in [github](https://github.com/Zhihan1996/DNABERT_2) that you recommended installing triton from source code but in one of the [issues](https://github.com/Zhihan1996/DNABERT_2/issues/57) you recommended installing a specific version using pip.
