contains_question: yes

question_part: Is it possible to fine-tuning the 7b1 model on 4 A100 (80G) gpus? I have tried many configurations the FT 7b1 on four A100. But unfortunately,  I got OOM all the time. So I am curious about minimal demands of GPUS to FT this model. Could you share your experiences?
