contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- First, I want to confirm that this will run on a non-CUDA machine. Here's what I'm working with:

  - 2023 MBP (M2 max)
  - 12 core CPU
  - 38 core GPU
  - 16 core Neural Engine
  - 96GB of Unified memory

  Given these specs, I believe my machine should be powerful enough to handle most tasks.

- Second, I'm curious if there are any guides specifically tailored for this model. I plan to use it for a bot in one of my web apps.
