contains_question: yes  
question_part: In Oobabooga what Instruction template do I select for Dolphin Mistral 2.1? Now after reinstalling fresh it's defaulting to Alpaca but I have not tested it? Do I need to load a custom Instruction template for best results? What should I select there for best results? I notice how some people choose the Default tab instead of Instruct should I do that too? Update I seem to read that I should choose ChatML as Instruction template.
