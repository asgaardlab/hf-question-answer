contains_question: yes

question_part: I believe that the example code for fine-tuning the base model `Pythia-6.9B` with `databricks_dolly_15k` to create `dolly-v2-7b` has not yet been published but I'm experimenting anyway, first with tokenizing `databricks_dolly_15k` before attempting to tokenize my own dataset, and likely just need some pointers to the correct tutorial or other resource.
