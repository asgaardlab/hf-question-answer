contains_question: yes

question_part: Model will take actions for you if you express intent for them, which is not the biggest deal but it is annoying. Out of all the mistral models I tried so far this is by far the smallest offender anyways, never writing dialogue for me. Didn't have success correcting this with any amount of instructions, can this be improved with more roleplay data?.

Can this model be improved?, would PIPPA dataset help maybe?.
