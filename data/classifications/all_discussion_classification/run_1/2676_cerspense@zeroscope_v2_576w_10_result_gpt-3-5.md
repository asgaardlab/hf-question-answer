contains_question: yes
question_part: Are these model files equivalent, despite their size difference? If not, does it mean that the A1111 pipeline is different from the Huggingface API pipeline in terms of computation and results, or is the VQGAN autoencoder file of the original modelscope not actually used in A1111
