contains_question: yes

question_part: Why dont you do this with a more prominent and popular model. Like mistral ai models (id recommend openchat-3.5-0106), or maybe one of the deepseekcoder-base models. The solar10b models would be a good option also. Im just saying, llama 2 is old news at this point
