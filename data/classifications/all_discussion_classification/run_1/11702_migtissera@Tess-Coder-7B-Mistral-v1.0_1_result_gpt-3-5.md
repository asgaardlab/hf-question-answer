contains_question: yes

question_part: If it's not too much to ask, I'm interested in your training process besides the dataset. (ex: lora/qlora, full fine tuning, anything unusual during training a.s.o.) I feel that also brings a lot of value, kind of like what you did with Tess, posting the learnings from training it.
