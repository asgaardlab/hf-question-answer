contains_question: yes

question_part: From what I researched so far, it seems https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/17060#issue-1224164597  LayoutLMv3 class implementation of huggingface doesn't support Document Layout analysis using your model. Will it we possible for you to share a basic code to use this model? taking a image as input and getting prediction boxes and labels as output or something? the github repo from 'unilm' is also not super clear on this
