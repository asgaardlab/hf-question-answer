contains_question: yes  
question_part: Great work! I compared Dreamshaper with SD 1.5 and found dreamshaper is more responsive to the different components in the prompt. Say "a man with a blue house in the background", SD sometimes generates images without "blue house in the background", but Dreamshaper almost always generates it. Wonder why is the difference?
