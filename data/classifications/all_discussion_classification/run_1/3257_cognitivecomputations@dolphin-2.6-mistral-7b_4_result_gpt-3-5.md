contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi @ehartford, when trying to load this model with ooba's Transformers loader, it only produces this traceback: 

I've redownloaded the model to make sure it didn't get corrupted during the download. I've also reinstalled ooba and made sure it's fully updated. Even manually updated the Transformers library. Still always the same problem. 

Any idea what could be the cause and how to solve it
