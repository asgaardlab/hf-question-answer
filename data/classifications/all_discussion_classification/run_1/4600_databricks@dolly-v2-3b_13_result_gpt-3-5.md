contains_question: yes

question_part: However, there's a `test-size` hyperparameter, which I'm not sure about.  I can't find mention of it in [their repo](https://github.com/microsoft/DeepSpeed) or [pypi](https://deepspeed.readthedocs.io). My training set is 1,000 datapoints. What should the hyperparams, especially `test-size` be to suit the training size?
