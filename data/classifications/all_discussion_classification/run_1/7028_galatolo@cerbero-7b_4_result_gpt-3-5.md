contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, i've wanted to try out your model for a personal project that I'm doing and I was wondering if you could provide some more documentation regarding the prompt style that needs to be used

Wanted to know what are the equivalents for this model and the general prompt usage, since even following the example on the readme I cannot get it to run properly, sometimes it continues to generate even after the fist message, and sometimes the generated response is missing the final vertical bar "|"
