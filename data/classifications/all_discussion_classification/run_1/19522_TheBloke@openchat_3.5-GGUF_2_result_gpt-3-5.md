contains_question: yes

question_part: Then I realized it's not just a language issue, the local model subjectively feels a lot dumber in every way than the online demo. One conversation, it began adding an emoji in front of each response and it would tell me that it'll stop while it kept doing it. Another chat, it wrote its first response as an ordered list and from then on every single answer was in a list. Even when I said thank you, it had to make it a list:
1. You're welcome! I'm glad I could help clarify some information for you. Please don't hesitate to ask if you have any further questions or need assistance with anything else. Have a great day!

And when I said thank you and please stop making everything into a list:
1. No problem! I apologize if my previous responses were too list-oriented. My intention is to help and inform you accurately, but I understand that some people prefer different formats.
2. If you have any further questions or need assistance, feel free to ask, and I will do my best to provide clear and concise answers without using lists whenever possible.
