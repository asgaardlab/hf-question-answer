contains_question: yes
question_part: I would like to ask whether this model is pre-trained or fine-tuned on the multiwo dataset, and what does the "1000" refer to in this "flan-t5-large-da-multiwoz_1000", and I would like to ask you about the current version of the T5 model trained on multiwoz, which works best, thank you for the answer.
