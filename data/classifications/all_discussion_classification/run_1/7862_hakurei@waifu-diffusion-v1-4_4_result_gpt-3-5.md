contains_question: yes
question_part: Is this something like detecting pictures generated by the Diffusion model and judging it as some probability? Like, if one picture just SD's variant model direct output, will have some 80 to 90% accuracy; If the pictures were already being edited by hand, or being filtered, then some 50% even 20 to 30% or lower.
