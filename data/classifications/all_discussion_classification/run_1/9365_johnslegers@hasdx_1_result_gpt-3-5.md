contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi @johnslegers ðŸ‘‹, it looks like the https://huggingface.co/BestJammer/HASDX and https://civitai.com/models/3758/hasdx models have interesting data in them, and they are poisoning other models if merged with them. We don't have a model_ema checker in the diffusers library yet. Did you remove the model_ema part before converting?
