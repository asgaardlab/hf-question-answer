contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm looking for a way to stop the generation whenever my task/prompt is fullfilled. Except from stop_words and max_length is there another stopping criteria that could be used to stop the generation. More specifically I want to 'force' the model to generate an end_of_sequence token before the max_length is reached. Any ideas
