contains_question: yes

question_part: My issue is that because Fashionclip is trained on clip-base, it has lower memory than clip-large, so it works less efficiently on memory-based queries (e.x. "real Madrid t-shirts"). I wonder if you have any repo you trained Fashionclip based on clip-large? I guess this would solve the problem.
