contains_question: yes

question_part: I'd love to see the script used to convert this model for MLX. Unlike the other Mistral models, this one isn't available as pth, and (afaik) only available from HF in transformer-compatible formats. There are quite a few models that are similarly only available on HF, and sharing how this one was converted would help provide an example of how to do such conversions for MLX.
