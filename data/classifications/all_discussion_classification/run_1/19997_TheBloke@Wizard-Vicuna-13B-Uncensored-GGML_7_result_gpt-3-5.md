contains_question: yes

question_part: Is that accurate or can I get away with only using one? How will that affect output quality and speed? What are all the other files for then and could they help me improve the quality and/or speed of my chat experience? As I've gathered from the commit messages from TheBloke's Hugging Face page it's something pertaining to k-quant, but I can't find any information as to what they're used for... Then, would I benefit from ONLY running the `q8_0.bin` for example or is my hardware not equipped to handle that load or am I better off running `q4_0.bin` or maybe I should go for the "newer" `q5_0.bin`?
