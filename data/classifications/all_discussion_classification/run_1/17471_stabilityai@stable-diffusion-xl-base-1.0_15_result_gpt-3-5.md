contains_question: yes

question_part: There seems to be visible red dots all over the image. I'd say maybe it's something I'm doing wrong but all images on Hugging Face's own docs also have the problem. Normally I'd say it could be some sort of an "invisible watermark" but it's making the image unusable so I'm guessing not. Does anyone know why this happens and how to fix it?
