contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Could you put the below into a plain-English series of git commands?  Because I (and ChatGPT, for that matter  ;)  ) am stumped as to what series of steps you want taken.

Oh, and on that note: "and make sure the gradio_temporalnet.py script points at the model." - when I cloned TemporalNet, the directory I got has nothing called "gradio_temporalnet.py".  Nor is it even clear what you mean by "that model folder".  From the AUTOMATIC1111 directory, do you mean models/Stable-diffusion, models/ControlNet, or extensions/sd-webui-controlnet[-TemporalNet-API]/models?

Lastly, is EBSynth required for this?  As a Linux user, when I search for EBSynth, the overwhelming majority of hits are some Windows GUI program (and in your tutorial, you appear to show a Windows GUI program).  I tried this:

... but all the results I've gotten from it are garbage... so juddery it's just best to skip it altogether and deal with StableDiffusion's flicker.
