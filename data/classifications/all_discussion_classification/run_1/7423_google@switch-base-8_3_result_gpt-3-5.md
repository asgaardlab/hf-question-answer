contains_question: yes

question_part: It seems there is no 'SwitchTransformersConditionalGeneration', but SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration
In the model card, the GPU example imports SwitchTransformersConditionalGeneration.
But it seems that there's no SwitchTransformersConditionalGeneration module, but SwitchTransformersForConditionalGeneration only exist.
Are those two things convertible?
