contains_question: yes  
question_part: I have just been working on a project on how can I reduce noise in the ecosystem by just filtering non-crypto related messages. Eg Telegram chats have a lot of messages, how can I just filter out messages/conversation which I don't care about. I guess we can extend your model to that as well.
