contains_question: yes
question_part: Embeddings?, Would it be possible to generate word embeddings from this model similar to how OpenAI offer their embeddings API like da-vinci? Also, does anyone know if a dedicated word embedding models like Word2Vec or Setence Transformers would be better for document search?
