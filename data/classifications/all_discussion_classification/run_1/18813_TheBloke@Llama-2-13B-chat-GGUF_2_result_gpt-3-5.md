contains_question: yes
question_part: My question is, what is the "value add" here? Are these models any different than Meta's Llama 2?
I am wondering if TheBloke:
- Trained each of these models separately from scratch?
- Or just provides different quantizations of the same pre-trained model?
I guess in general, besides posting these models on huggingface, what other things is TheBloke doing for these models?
