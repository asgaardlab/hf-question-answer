contains_question: yes

question_part: I tried stop_sequence, but got error like below
```The following `model_kwargs` are not used by the model: ['stop_sequence'] (note: typos in the generate 
arguments will also show up in this list)```  
how can i setting arguments in `gpt.generate()`?  
is there any ideas?
