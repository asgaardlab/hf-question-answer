contains_question: yes
question_part: I use barcodes TSV, the features, TSV and matrix. These three files for loom MTX format file, after tokening in the dataset arrow file is only 464bytes, 
Then I downloaded loom file from GEO, and found that after tokening it is still only a few hundred bytes, my own data is now in fastq format, so do you have any good suggestions for input data? 
 And for {"cell_type": "cell_type", "organ_major": "organ_major"}, since it is optional, why does the code not work when I remove this parameter?
