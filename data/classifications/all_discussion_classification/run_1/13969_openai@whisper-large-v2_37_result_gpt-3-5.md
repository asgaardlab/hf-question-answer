contains_question: yes

question_part: Is anyone aware of any application/service that would enable me to:
- hit a shortcut on my keyboard
- start speaking
- have my speech transcribed into whatever application I had open

In other words, I would like to be able to use Whisper in a similar way to how I currently use Dragon Dictate.
