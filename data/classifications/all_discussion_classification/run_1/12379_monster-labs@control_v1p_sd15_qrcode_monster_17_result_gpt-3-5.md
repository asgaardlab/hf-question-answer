contains_question: yes
question_part: I had a few questions about the ideal parameters for QR generation in order to work best with this model. I'm assuming the module size of 16px is relative to a total resolution of 512x512 right? You would want to optimize the error correction to maintain those block sizes? Is there a specific border size that is optimized for the model or has it been trained on many border sizes
