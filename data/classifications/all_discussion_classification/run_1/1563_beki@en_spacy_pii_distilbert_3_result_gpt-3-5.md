contains_question: yes  
question_part: When I try to load model I get an error message config.json is not found. Its also not visible under files and version tab. I am guessing its config might be from base model 'distilbert-base-uncased'. If that's right then I have raised a PR to push config.json file from distilbert-base-uncased model. If that's not right, @beki can you help?
