contains_question: yes

question_part: Since I only found 7B 100k models, I am assuming evaluation above was done between 7B models and Claude2. I bet Claude2 could be some over 200B MoE monster model to obey the scaling law of emergence. If 7B 100K model is that good, I cannot wait to see what you guys can achieve with bigger models.
