contains_question: yes  
question_part: 
Also, would love to learn if there are instructions on how to fine-tune the model. Would it improve the quality? What I am looking for as an improvement is kind of whether it can produce less TTS-like clear pronunciations and learn some special speech patterns if given more data. (Like someone may pronounce certain words non-standard with an accent)
