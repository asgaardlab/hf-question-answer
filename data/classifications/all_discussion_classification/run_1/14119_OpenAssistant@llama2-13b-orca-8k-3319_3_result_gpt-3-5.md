contains_question: yes
question_part: - Is this a typo in Readme?
- Is this model trained with any coding data? given that it has 8k context, it'll be excellent use case for coding assistant.
- Is there any prompt format for this model to answer questions based on context? for example using it for document chat using vector db.
- did you happen to benchmark this model? while I can wait for open llm leaderboard, it may take few days for this model to be evaluated in the leaderboard.
