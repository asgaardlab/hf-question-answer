contains_question: yes

question_part: I thought to move on to inference endpoints for deployment. I started with deployoing the initial model directly to check, but I am getting an error there which is 

module 'torch.nn.functional' has no attribute 'scaled_dot_product_attention'

i dont know how to solve this, can someone please guide
