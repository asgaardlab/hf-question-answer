contains_question: yes
question_part: My question is should I replace the files downloaded from zs2_576w folder, with the files having the same names that are available in the 'zs2_XL folder'? Because the instructions in both specify replacing the original files in the same target directory i.e. - 'stable-diffusion-webui\models\ModelScope\t2v' directory.
