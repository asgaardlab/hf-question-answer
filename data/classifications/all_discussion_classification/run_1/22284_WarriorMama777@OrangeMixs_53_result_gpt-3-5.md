contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1) Did merging Anything v3 with other models solve the "overfitting" issue due to additional data being added to the model? In the model description for BloodOrangeMix, it is mentioned that it is "stable", what does this mean exactly? 
2) As an end user, should I really care about whether BloodOrangeMix (or any other OrangeMix model for this matter) is overfitted if all I want is a general purpose anime model that could do anything including adult content?
