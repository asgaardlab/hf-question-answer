contains_question: yes

question_part: Since this model is based on deepSeek, I assume that the chat_template is similar to deepSeek's template with a bit modification.
I try to write the chat_template for this model based on deepSeek and magicCoder README, may I ask your help to confirm if this chat template is correct?
