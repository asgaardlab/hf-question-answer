contains_question: yes

question_part: I have started getting responses that do not follow my prompt as of today. I ask it to start a story or dream or anything similar of some sort, gave it the stuff it needed to create/start a story, like characters/plotlines/etc... but then it continues the story instead of starting it in the response it gives, and I didn't ask it to continue the story or something like that in any way.
