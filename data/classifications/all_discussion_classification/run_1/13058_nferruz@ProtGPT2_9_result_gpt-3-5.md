contains_question: yes

question_part: My first question is that by only doing this I got a CUDA out-of-memory error and I had to trim my train set (from 240 sequences to 10). Could you please provide documentation on how to resolve this issue? And finally, can you maybe explain how we can get the optimized learning rate? Because with only this line of code I got confused.
