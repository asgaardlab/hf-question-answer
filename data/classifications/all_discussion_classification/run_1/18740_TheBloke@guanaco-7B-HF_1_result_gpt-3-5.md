question_part: Where to place the instruction in the prompt format

Model instructions, or prompts, are crucial for providing guidance to the model on how to generate the desired text. In the case of Guanaco, the instruction typically consists of a few shot examples of the desired text to provide context for the model. 

If you want the model to speak like a specific person, you can include details about that person's style, tone, or specific phrases they use in the prompt. You can provide examples of how that person speaks or the type of content they usually generate. 

To structure the prompt for this purpose, you can start by introducing the characteristics of the person you want the model to emulate. For example, "Imagine you are speaking as [name of the person], a [description of their style]." Then, you can follow this with examples of text or phrases that person would typically use. 

By incorporating these details into the prompt, you can guide the model to generate text that aligns with the specified persona. It's essential to provide clear and specific instructions to help the model understand the desired output accurately.
