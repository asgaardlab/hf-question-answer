contains_question: yes

question_part: Let me get to the meat and potatoes. What are the two datasets that make up LosslessMegaCodeTrainingVersion3, below you will find brief descriptions of how they are different. I highly recommend using one of these two datasets, however if you do not follow my philosophy of the "LosslessCoding" that I have mentioned above, I will link two more datasets that are purely meant for code only, you can combine these two and they will be only coding data without any non-coding data. However only commitpackft has been filtered so that dataset is the best version to use if you want pure, filtered coding data.
