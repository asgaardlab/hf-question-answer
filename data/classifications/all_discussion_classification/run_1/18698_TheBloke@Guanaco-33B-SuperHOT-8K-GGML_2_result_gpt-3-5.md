contains_question: yes
question_part: Will this work at 4K or 8K context in oobabooga yet? Will this work at 4K or 8K context in oobabooga yet? I noticed Oobabooga seems to now support 70B GGML  at up to 4K is that right? With the Llama 2? Does this update apply to using models like this at either 4K or 8K? Just wondering. And if so does anyone know optimal settings in Oobabooga?
