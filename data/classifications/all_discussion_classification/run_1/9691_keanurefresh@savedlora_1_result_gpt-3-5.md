question_part: 
Do you happen to have additional info on how to use them? Some LoRAs have keywords, and I wonder if you keep those keywords along with the files, too? Or do you know where I could find such instructions?

Also, do you happen to know if there are other sources of models that "disappear"? A "graveyard", so-to-say?
