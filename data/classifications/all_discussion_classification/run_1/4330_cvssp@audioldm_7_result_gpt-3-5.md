contains_question: yes

question_part: As far as I understand, in the config of the unet you set the `num_class_embeds` to null or none. So, this shouldn't be an error. A you can see by my code, I also tried to force the `num_class_embeds` to 0 when I initialize my unet object unsuccessfully. Can you help me?
