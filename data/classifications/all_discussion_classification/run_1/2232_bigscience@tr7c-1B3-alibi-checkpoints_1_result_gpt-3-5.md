contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi, I am trying to follow the paper from https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.15424.pdf And I can't find any of the ablations. The SwiGlu appears to be only a log file, the Alibi seems empty as well. Is it possibly that at some point in the past or on some server you still have those (or any other model pertaining ablations you know of)?
