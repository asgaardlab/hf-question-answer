contains_question: yes
question_part: I am reaching out to inquire about the possibility of sharding the Yarn-Mistral-7b-64k model. By providing a sharded version of the Yarn-Mistral-7b-64k model, we can democratize access, enabling a broader range of users to experiment with and benefit from this impressive model. If there's any possibility to consider this, or if there are alternative solutions that could accommodate the needs mentioned above, I'd love to hear your thoughts.
