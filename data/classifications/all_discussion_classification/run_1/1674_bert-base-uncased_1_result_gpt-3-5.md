contains_question: yes
question_part: Multi-token masks? Suppose I know the beginning and end of a text, but don't know exactly how many tokens I want filled in. Maybe I can just set a minimum and maximum number of tokens. Can I do this with the Inference API? If not, how would I do it in my own code?
