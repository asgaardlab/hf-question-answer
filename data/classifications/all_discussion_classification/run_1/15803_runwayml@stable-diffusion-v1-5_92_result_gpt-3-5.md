contains_question: yes

question_part: Just wonder that, this ckpt is trained with resolution 512*512, but when I look at the laion-aesthetics v2 5+ dataset at https://huggingface.co/datasets/ChristophSchuhmann/improved_aesthetics_5plus, seems like a large portion of images are lower than 512*512. During training, should all those low resolution images be filtered out or just use everything?
