contains_question: yes

question_part: Is there any model support 256x256 or 224x224 image-to-image generation? The current model seems to only support 512x512 image input, and 256x256 input will cause the generated image to become all noise. And the main problem is with the unet, the other modules seem to work fine. Is there any unet trained on 256x256?
