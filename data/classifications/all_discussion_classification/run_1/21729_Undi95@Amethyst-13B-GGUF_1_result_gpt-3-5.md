contains_question: yes
question_part: lol I've asked this before and feel annoying now.... 
But you could you possibly do a 3ks quant for this?
I feel like huggin v1.2 for logic and xwin for prose should be enough and maybe too many models in the merge would dilute xwin's narrative rich sentence structure (unless it was similar models like synthia). 
If it were me I'd do huggin v1.2 + stheno for logic in the gradient mix (maybe ties merge - Ties merges seem better for logic preservation I think, ideally it could hold on to some of huggin's emergent CoT whilst gaining stheno's coherency and logic), and xwin + synthia + chronos for prose (this could be a slerp - slerps seem better for creativity. xwin and synthia have similar deep narrative sentence structure, xwin having a slight edge but lack chronos' great adjective use, actual word prose). I dream of GPU's.....and I probably don't know what I'm talking about. Anyway, by all means, ignore me :P Thanks for the amazing merge work you do. You are a machine!
