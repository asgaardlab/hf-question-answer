Tried to allocate 674.00 MiB (GPU 0; 15.98 GiB total capacity; 14.77 GiB already allocated; 0 bytes free; 15.43 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation. `  error. Do you have any improvement measures or any requirements for my memory.
