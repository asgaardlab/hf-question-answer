contains_question: yes

question_part: However, it seems to me that the upscaling process does not do justice to the PaperCut creations. I'm creating a video, using deforum, and the upscaling I'm using (realesr-animevideov3) seems to ruin the results a bit. Do you have any advice how to properly upscale the PaperCut creations?
