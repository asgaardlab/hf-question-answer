contains_question: yes

question_part: I would like though to understand what means "GPL" for an AI model. If an business would use a server running the snoozy model "as a service" (accessible through a set of custom APIs) as it is, would this be considered as an infringement of the GPL license ? If not can we thus consider that Snoozy, under certain conditions, is available for commercial use.
