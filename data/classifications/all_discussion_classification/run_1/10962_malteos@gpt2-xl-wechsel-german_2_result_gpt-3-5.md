contains_question: yes
question_part: Now I am wondering if you are interested in replicating the fine-tuning process for a slightly larger model on the German dataset, but the model should not be as heavy as Llama2-7b, which imposes a lot of challenge to full-scale fine-tuning on my private customer-level GPU, an RTX 4090.
