contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm trying to fine-tune the model without quantization, but when I get to the training phase, I encounter this error and haven't been able to resolve it. I've attempted various approaches regarding the input data in SFTTrainer â€“ both using formatting functions and without, just with a text field. I've also experimented with different parameters, but I'm not sure what the issue is. Could someone please assist me?
