contains_question: yes
question_part: Sorry for the dumb question, but if I used `Envvi/Inkpunk-Diffusion` as the $MODEL_NAME (not the ckpt filename, just the folder path), did it pick up `Inkpunk-Diffusion-v2.ckpt` to use and not the v1 ckpt which is also in that folder?  I see `pretrained_model_name_or_path` in the source code has some logic, but not sure what it all means. Just being a little OCD or paranoid or whatever.
