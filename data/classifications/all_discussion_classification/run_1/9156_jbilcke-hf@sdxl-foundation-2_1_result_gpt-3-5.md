contains_question: yes

question_part: I see a safetensor file in the root directory, that matches the name of the archive, I see a bunch of your training folder data, like 2000 and 3000. Is the lora the 23 mb pytorch in the 3000 folder? Should I just take that safetensor and rename it? I was wondering if you could explain how/which file to get from these archives.
