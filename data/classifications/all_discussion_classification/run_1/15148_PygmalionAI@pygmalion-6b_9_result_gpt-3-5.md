contains_question: yes

question_part: Hey there, I’m here to ask you if we could collaborate together to integrate Pygmalion into an AI platform I’m making where users can create AIs of all types (not only Pygmalion characters) for free and  with no code or advanced knowledge requiered and then share or sell them with even a free API they can use on their own websites or apps. What do you think about helping with me with this?
