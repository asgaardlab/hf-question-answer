contains_question: yes

question_part: Brandon's model customization that you converted in GGML doesn't have the success it deserves. It's performing better than SuperHot 8k, and it's now my main model, in GPTQ and GGML, for Silly Tavern RP scenarios. Could you make a GGML quantization in Q3_KS and share it with us?
