contains_question: yes
question_part: Like the title suggests - I wanted to load this model in my local ooba install - but it seems unable to. I'm sure this is known, but I cannot resolve it on my own - the error seems to be related to missing files in the model directory - especially the "tokenizer.config" file and all other tokenizer-relevant ones.
