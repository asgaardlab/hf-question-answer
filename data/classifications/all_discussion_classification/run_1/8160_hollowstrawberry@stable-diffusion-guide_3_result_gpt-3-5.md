contains_question: yes

question_part: Dataset/LoRa not working? I'm trying to figure out the problem with the lora training colab, are there any problems with not using gelbooru for tags? the first step worked in that it created a drive directory and I was able to import my images for analysis, but the second step has been nothing but problems and things not being defined? Am I missing something?
