contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm getting a model has no attribute type 'none' error when trying to use this in comfyui - when loading the unet, clips, and vae seperately, and when using the diffusers loader node, in both fp16 and reegular modes, not sure if this is a model issue or a comfy thing since other diffusers models work fine for me.
