contains_question: yes

question_part: I exported this model to onnx (decoder.onnx, encoder.onnx, ..). Now I would like to load it into some C# code and use it. I tried with Tutorials like https://onnxruntime.ai/docs/tutorials/csharp/bert-nlp-csharp-console-app.html, but I run into Error: "Tensor element data type discovered: Int64 metadata expected: Float".
