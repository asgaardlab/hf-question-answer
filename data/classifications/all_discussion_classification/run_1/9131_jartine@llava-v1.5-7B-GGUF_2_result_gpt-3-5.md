contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi. I did the 13B GGUF for these and was wondering if you would be so kind as to point me at the docs / script / something you used to compress the CLIP mmproj - I recall seeing something like that being available on some linux branch of something but for the life of me can't dredge it up. Would really appreciate the assist.
