contains_question: yes

question_part: How is there 29 million downloads last month? Can someone please fill me in
Excluse me for my ignorance but I was just browsing stable diffusion models when I clicked to sort hugging face by popularity. I know very little about BERT this is the first I have heard of it but after reading a little bit I still don't understand the volume of downloads where is this coming from? Is the model being downloaded by a certain popular app or please if anyone could fill me in.
