contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi Christina, could you clarify something for me? Below is a plot of the cell embeddings extracted from my model fine-tuned using OA data. Can the cosine shift be explained as how far on the coordinate plane the diseased cell embedding moves towards the centroid of the healthy cells, as indicated in the first plot below? Would a better approach be imitating the natural progression of diseased cells, but in reverse, as in the second figure?
