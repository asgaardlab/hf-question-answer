contains_question: yes

question_part: In your paper, you mentioned that you designed two separate prompt templates for each scenario concerning monolingual semantic textual similarity (STS) tasks and bitext retrieval tasks. However, the paper does not explicitly detail how these two prompts were formulated. Could you kindly provide complete examples for these prompts, similar to what was done for the retrieval task?
