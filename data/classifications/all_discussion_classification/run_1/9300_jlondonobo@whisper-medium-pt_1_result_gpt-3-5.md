contains_question: yes
question_part: Hello, thank you for training this, because I am having memory issues when trying to use this model, is this not the "Medium" model of whisper?
I can use the original medium model of whisper normally, but when I try to use this fine-tuned model, I am having VRAM issues, was it not supposed to have the same consumption as the original?
Why is this error occurring? I await your response, thank you.
