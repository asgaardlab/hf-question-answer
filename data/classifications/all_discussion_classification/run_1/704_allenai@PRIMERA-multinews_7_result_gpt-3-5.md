contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi everyone, has anyone been successful in using the model using the `transformer` library's `pipeline`  If I change the `task` parameter in the `pipeline()` call to `"summarization"`, it gives me a **slightly** better result, but overall it's still quite bad and short  Can anyone help me as I've never really done anything like this before and I'm not sure how to do it properly  Thanks
