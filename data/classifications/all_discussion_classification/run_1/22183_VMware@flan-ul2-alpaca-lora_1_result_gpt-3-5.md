contains_question: yes

question_part: I have few questions if you don't mind:
1) Did you load the mode in 8 bit while fine-tuning (i.e. set load_in_8bit=True)? 
1) Were you using multi-GPU for fine-tuning?
2)  Did you encounter any of these errors when you're fine-tuning? If so, could you please share with me how did you fix them?
