contains_question: yes
question_part: Is it possible to generate multiple images from a seed image and different text prompts? For example, I have a seed image of a cowboy, then I want to generate two images of "cowboy ridding a duck" and "cowboy riding a penguin" based on the seed image. Is it feasible?
