contains_question: yes
question_part: Great work! I am willing to use Geneformer right now. Do you have any plans on uploading an example `"/path/to/cell_type_train_data.dataset"` file, or/and providing a tutorial on how to convert standard single cell count data into a valid dataset to feed into Geneformer? Thanks!
