contains_question: yes
question_part: In the code example that's provided on the *Model Card* page, the `logits_per_image` variable is referred to as the image-text _similarity_ score. If these _are_ the text-image similarity scores, then how would applying the `softmax()`function on these similarity scores make any sense?
