contains_question: yes

question_part: I noticed that the section `Datasets used to train sentence-transformers/sentence-t5-base` is missing for the ST5 family of models. Is it exactly the same as the one used for [all-mpnet-base-v2](https://huggingface.co/sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2) (namely, `wikihow`, `eli5` and `snli`)?
