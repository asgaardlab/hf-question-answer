contains_question: yes
question_part: How to run this with Huggingface transformers library?
I got the same error as one of the issues
```mayaeary/pygmalion-6b_dev-4bit-128g does not appear to have a file named pytorch_model.bin, tf_model.h5, model.ckpt or flax_model.msgpack.```
I'm assuming I probably need to load a GPT neoX 6B model, then change the weights to your .safetensors file..
I' really not sure how tho. pls help, need to make anime wife.
