contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I am interested in performing transfer learning on this model for Brazilian Portuguese. However, it appears to be incompatible with the training script offered in the NVIDIA/NeMo repository. Could you provide the model in a compatible format or inform me if there is a way to utilize this ".nemo" model as an initial checkpoint to train the SpellChecker?
