contains_question: yes

question_part: I guess one thing that I don't yet understand is how to increase the context window so that it remembers the conversation for longer. I'd love to have 4096 or higher context window, but I don't yet understand where the limitation is. Is it in the base model itself and the way it's trained, or something else? Not a setting I can change?
