contains_question: yes

question_part: However, unfortunately, I am getting a CPU-side out-of-memory error (kernel crashes) while trying to even download the model checkpoint from HuggingFace to the notebook (in other words, the process does not even get to the GPU stage).  Am I doing something wrong?  Or is this model just too large for the free-tier Google Colab account?  I counted that the two binary files add up to 15GB, but am not sure if this is the correct calculation.  Or perhaps there is a special technique that has to be employed in order to be able to download this model?  It would be nice to get the official guidance; or maybe somebody knowledgeable can advise.
