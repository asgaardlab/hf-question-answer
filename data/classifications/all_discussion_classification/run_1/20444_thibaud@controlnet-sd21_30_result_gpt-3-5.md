question_part: Can't get scribble to work
I'm having trouble making the scribble model work. I am using automatic1111 with the sd-webui-controlnet extension. I do a basic scribble in img2img but the result does not take the scribble into account. Also in the result folder I usually see the scribble being generated along with the result image, but there is no scribble image there. I have tried both the 512 and the 768 versions of SD-2.1. I have tried img2img and text2img in automatic1111. I have tried preprocessor scribble and fake scribble
