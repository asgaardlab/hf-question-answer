contains_question: yes

question_part: Ooba is refusing to apply LoRAs for me (I did just update, about to test again), so I'm curious if anyone has stress tested the model for refusals. The Vicuna Free model is refusing certain classes of questions even in roleplay scenarios like robbing banks and other similar things. Just wanted to see if that's also happening with the LoRA.
