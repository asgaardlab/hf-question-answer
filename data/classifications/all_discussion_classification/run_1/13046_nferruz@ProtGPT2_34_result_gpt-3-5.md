contains_question: yes
question_part: When you download it you get several .csv.gz files with headers containing information such as specie among others, and each line has several pieces of information, but I am interested in the numbering (a way to part the different regions of an antibody sequence) and the type of chain (heavy/light). How can I train ProtGPT2 with a sectionned sequence (by using "/" for example to delimit each region) and some features or labels?
