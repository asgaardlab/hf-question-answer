contains_question: yes

question_part: My inference code is list below. Fuyu-8b gives reasonable results for input text & image prompts examples on the huggingface page, but outputs non-sense for anything else. See "life expectancy case v2" and "life expectancy cas v3" for results of just slightly modifying the text prompts. See "big ben coco caption case" and other cases below for text prompts and image prompts used by the offical blog. I'm wondering if this is the expected behavior of fuyu-8b or I made some mistake in the inference code part.
