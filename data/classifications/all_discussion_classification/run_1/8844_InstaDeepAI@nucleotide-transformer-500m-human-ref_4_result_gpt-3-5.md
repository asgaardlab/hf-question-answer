contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi, I recently observed that the embeddings generated by the models provided in the GitHub repo and the Hugging Face models are different for the same input sequence. In the Hugging Face model, embeddings are generated after layer normalization (for example, layer 23 for my model). However, in the model from the GitHub repo, embeddings are generated before layer normalization. This discrepancy might lead to differences in the downstream applications. I'd appreciate it if you could clarify this issue and suggest a way to make both models consistent in terms of the generated embeddings. Thank you!
