contains_question: yes

question_part: Why was the config changed? What is this? @rwitz What are you trying to hide? It is forbidden to throw check points while training a model, and you did, and you didn't even give me credit. Secondly, you didn't train. It's not a good thing to use merge and tell people you trained them, my friend. If you do not disclose it to everyone, I will open a discussion on you in Open LLM and report you.
