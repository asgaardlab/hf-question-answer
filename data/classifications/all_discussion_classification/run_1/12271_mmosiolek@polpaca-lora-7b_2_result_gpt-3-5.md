contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I've read your blog post, results seem to be quite promisting. I have 2 questions:
1. On what machine have you run your tests (inference and fine-tunning)? I tried inference on aws g5.2xlarge (24GB GPU RAM) and it was still not enough so I needed to put model on cpu.
2. Have you been able to get such good results in a consistent manner because mine look much worse. Maybe I'm missing sth. Could you please take a look?
