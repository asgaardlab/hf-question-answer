contains_question: yes
question_part: Why is this model the exact same as Llama 2 Chat 13B? You didn't just take Meta's Llama 2 Chat model and renamed it h2oGPT without making any changes, did you? Just wondering if your model is a 1:1 copy of meta's original? Or if there was a mistake/mix-up when the model was quantized/uploaded?
