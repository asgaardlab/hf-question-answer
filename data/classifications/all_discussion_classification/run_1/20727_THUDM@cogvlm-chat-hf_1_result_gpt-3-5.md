contains_question: yes
question_part: Is the hf version the same as the biligual demo version in Chatglm.cn?
Is it biligual version?
Any setup for its api application?
I tried the demo version and i want to see it is one of the best so far, compared to the other open ones even GPT 4.
In Github repo, it shows that there will be one better version available soon, will be still be 17b or bigger?
