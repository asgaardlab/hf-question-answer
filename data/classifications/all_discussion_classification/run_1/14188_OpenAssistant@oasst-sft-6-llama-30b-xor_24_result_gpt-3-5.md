contains_question: yes

question_part: The problem that i had is that the Tokenizer did not like the `added_tokens.json` file. After xor_decoding that file is not valid JSON, just some binaries. All other files has correct md5sum  What should i do about it?
How can i overcome that problem? How to make it talk?
