contains_question: yes

question_part: It seems newer versions of the `transformers` library expect a `tokenizer_config.json` file. I wonder if the model https://huggingface.co/KBLab/wav2vec2-large-voxrex-swedish/ uses the same `tokenizer_config.json`, and if so, if the file there could be copied here.
