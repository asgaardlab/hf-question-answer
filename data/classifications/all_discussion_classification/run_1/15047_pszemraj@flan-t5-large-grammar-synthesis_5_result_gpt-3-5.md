contains_question: yes

question_part: Would you mind sharing some details on how you trained. I saw it is an expanded version of JFLEG, do you add many extra samples ? Also, are the model params seen [here](https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/t5-v1_1-base-ft-jflAUG) what you use ? I would like to give `google/flan-t5-xl` or `-xxl` a try. Best, Darragh.
