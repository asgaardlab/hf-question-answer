contains_question: yes
question_part: Would this approach be feasible for studying cell-cell communication using Geneformer?
Would this require retraining the model from scratch, or could we leverage fine-tuning for this task?
If fine-tuning can be applied, could you suggest a possible methodology to carry it out for this specific scenario?
