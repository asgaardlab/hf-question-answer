contains_question: yes
question_part: I do not see pre-processors previews. What files need to be paired with pth or safetensors in controlnet extension models folder? Also, if I usually alternate between 1.5 and 2.1 for different results, I get the problem that the models are mixed up in the toggle window, and i cannot see what checkpoint they are for.. can i put them in folders within the models?
