contains_question: yes

question_part: What exactly does the "use_cache=False" do? In the Colab under the "load model and tokenizer" section the Cache is disabled. Does this improve the performance of the model, or does changing it to "use_cache=True" use extra resources, or make it unstable? Just curious.
