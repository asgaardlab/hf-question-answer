contains_question: yes
question_part: How long was this model trained?
How many steps/epochs was this particular model trained on? And which of the datasets was used: was it [https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/tree/main/TinyStories-train.txt](https://huggingface.co/datasets/roneneldan/TinyStories/blob/main/TinyStories-train.txt)?
I can only find Figure 3 in the paper showing 2.5K steps. Am I right that it translates into ~1.5 epochs using the TinyStories-train.txt dataset and parameters from the model card?
