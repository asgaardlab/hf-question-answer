contains_question: yes

question_part: I really like this model, but I wonder what it would be like if it used spicyboros instead of normal airoboros. I found that airoboros 7b wasn't too smart but I was genuinely impressed by spicyboros, I feel like it was much smarter. Any chance we could get a merge just like this but using spicyboros instead?
