contains_question: yes
question_part: Why distilling to SSD-1B rather than SD1.5/2.1? Notice that SSD-1B has close numbers of parameters of UNet comparing to SD1.5/2.1. So why use the UNet  truncated from SDXL rather than reuse SD1.5/2.1? Maybe for the sake of the two language models which SDXL used?
