contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- Is this repetitive response a known feature or behavior of the Mistral-7B-v0.1 model?
- Are there any specific settings or parameters within the litellm library or the model's API that I need to adjust to obtain a single response for a single query?
- Could this issue be related to the way the litellm library handles the API requests?
- I would greatly appreciate any insights or guidance you could provide on this matter.
