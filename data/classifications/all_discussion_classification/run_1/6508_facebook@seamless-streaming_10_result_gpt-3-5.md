contains_question: yes
question_part: Has anyone actually used this for Real Time (near realtime) translation yet? So far I have the M4t demo model up and running and I want to get cracking at the real time editor.. I wonder what's the best way to go about this.. open up loop with audio stream? output a stream of text? Process in chunks? Where would I separate audio chunks to pass the model? I'm just thinking out loud.. Maybe i'll start and clip in 2 second chunk as I read this is the latency, but I feel it will lose the context from more complete chunks..
