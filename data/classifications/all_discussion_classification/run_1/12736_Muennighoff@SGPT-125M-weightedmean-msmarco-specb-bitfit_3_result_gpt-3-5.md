contains_question: yes
question_part: While I have your attention: I want an open weights embedding model with max sequence length >= 1024 and a size < 1Gb. This is the first model I found that meets that criteria. I would be using the model for RAG semantic search. Is there any reason why I might want to find another model? Performance perhaps?
