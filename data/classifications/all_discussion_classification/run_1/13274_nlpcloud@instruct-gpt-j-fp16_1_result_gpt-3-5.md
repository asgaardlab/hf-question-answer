contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm trying to do few-shot learning (classification) with the GPT-J model, but it doesn't seem to do a good job. So, I've come across your instruct-gptj model. I tried the few-shot learning, it doesn't seem to understand few-shot learning now, does it? Maybe I'm doing something completely wrong. what if I want to do the few-shot and provide a few examples for each class? will it work? Do you have any sample prompts? or have you not tested this?
