contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi all, I have been trying to use this model on a laptop without any GPU for one of my course projects. Naturally, I am required to load this model in 8-bit quantization form. However, whenever I try to load it in a quantized state, I get an error stating that the accelerate and bits-and-bytes libraries are not present. I made to sure install those libraries in my virtual environment, yet the error persists. Please help me.
