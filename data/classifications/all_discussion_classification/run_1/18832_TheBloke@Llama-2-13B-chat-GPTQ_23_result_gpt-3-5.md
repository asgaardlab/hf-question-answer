contains_question: yes
question_part: My first issue is with llama-cpp-python. I used "pip install llama-cpp-python" to install it, but it appears to have incomplete files. As a result, I had to clone the repository just to build the project. The second issue is with the command "./main -t 10 -ngl 32 -m llama-2-13b-chat.ggmlv3.q4_0.bin --color -c 4096 --temp 0.7 --repeat_penalty 1.1 -n -1 --in-prefix-bos --in-prefix ' [INST] ' --in-suffix ' [/INST]' -i -p '[INST] <<SYS>> You are a helpful, respectful, and honest assistant. <</SYS>> Write a story about llamas. [/INST]'". Because the pip method installed incomplete files, I had to clone the entire repository. But even after successfully building the project, the main executable is missing. I'm not sure if it's failing to generate or if there's another problem. As a result, I can't execute the command because ./main is missing please refer to the attached screenshot.
