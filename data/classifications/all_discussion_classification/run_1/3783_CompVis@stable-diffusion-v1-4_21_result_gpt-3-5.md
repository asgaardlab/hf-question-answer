contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi, I have created a virtual environment for StableDiffusion, but I don't know what the required modules are. Could some kind soul please provide a list of requirements (and versions) for a conda Python 3.9 and CUDA 11.6 environment? Perhaps a "requirements.txt" file I could pip install? Any hints would be appreciated!
