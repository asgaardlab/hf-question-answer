contains_question: yes  
question_part: Hi, I have an mp4, 2 channels audio file that I want to transcribe, and everything I got for now is the only one letter ['e'] recognized. So I tried resampling my file to a 16000 sample rate with librosa, pytorch, ffmpeg, tried converting sample rate, bitrate, tried different formats - with no result. I'm starting to think that this is no format issue but the way recognizer works with this file... Could you suggest something please?
