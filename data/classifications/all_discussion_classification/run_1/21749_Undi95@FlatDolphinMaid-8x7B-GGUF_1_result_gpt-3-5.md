contains_question: yes

question_part: I've got another (dumb? genius?) merge request for ya man! So here's the idea - I was hoping there was a way you could mash Noromaid 7b into some 10.7b frankenmerge (something I've never been able to work out), maybe with toppy 7b? Or whatever you think would be fun or clever. Or not, and tell me to go eat dirt. As usual! I can't expect anything really you make SO many merges.
