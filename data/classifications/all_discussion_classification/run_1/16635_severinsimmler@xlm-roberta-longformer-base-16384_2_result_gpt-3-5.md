contains_question: yes

question_part: While I am trying to use the large version of the original model (https://huggingface.co/hyperonym/xlm-roberta-longformer-large-16384). Do you have any interest to create it? Or would you mind sharing the method for converting the original TF model into this pytorch version, so that I could try by myself?
