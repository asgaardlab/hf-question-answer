contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm new to SD, so forgive me if it's a dumb question, but I was using this model and now see it was recently updated and `model_index.json` was removed. Diffusers is now complaining about the file not being found when I pass `from_pretrained('prompthero/openjourney-v4')`, saying the `model_index.json` is not found. Is there a way for me to generate the file myself or does the model creator need to manage all of this?
