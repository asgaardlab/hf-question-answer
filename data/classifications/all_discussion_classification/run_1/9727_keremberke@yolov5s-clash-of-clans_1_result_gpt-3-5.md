contains_question: yes

question_part: i have a simple question can i use your dataset or script to make the clash of clans strategies. like if i show a base design to your dataset than it will help me to tell me what army i should choose to attack on a base and from where to start an attack to make data attack a 3 star attack. like for example i am sharing a picture of a base of town hall 9 i am not owner of this base i have downloaded this base from https://cocbases.net/th9-war-base/ i just wanna know that are they really sharing the real bases because they claim that their bases are anti 3 star and anti eveything.
