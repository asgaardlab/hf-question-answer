contains_question: yes

question_part: I would like to know how you guys are creating these formats (sharded, q4f16 or q3f16). I am asking, because I wanted to try the llama2 uncensored on my iphone and on ipad, but whenever i try to start a conversation, the app crashes. I noticed, that these crashes only occur, if I try to use q4 models. The q3 models do work fine, but unfortunately none of the q4 models.
