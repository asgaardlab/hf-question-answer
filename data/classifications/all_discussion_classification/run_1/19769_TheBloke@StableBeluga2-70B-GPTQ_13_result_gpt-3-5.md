contains_question: yes
question_part: Why so few 8 bit capable models?
Is there something special about 8bit quantized that makes it undesirable?
Is it a performance thing that there isn't much difference between 8 and 4 or is it more that there aren't many people that could do 8 and not do 16 so there just isn't a demand?
It just seemed really odd to me that 8bit just isn't very prevalent at all in the community.
