contains_question: yes

question_part: Falcon is stunning but will you continue or is the majestic bird destined to starve?
That said will there be updates ? New variants, fresh training updates to stay up to date ?
Or is this a one-time project, in that case Falcon won't fly for long which would be such a shame for the time and energy you invested in the first place.
Would be awesome to get a short response from TII/devs if there is a future or if this is the end of the road for now
