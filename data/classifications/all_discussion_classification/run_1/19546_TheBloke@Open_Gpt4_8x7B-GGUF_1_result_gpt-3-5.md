This is just a very basic representation of a fish, it's not meant to be realistic. ASCII art can be a fun and creative way to represent images using text characters, but keep in mind that it might lack the details of traditional image or diagram.

why is that there are two sets of primary colors?

AI
The traditional color theory identifies three primary colors: red, blue, and yellow. However, in the context of subtractive color mixing (used in painting and printing), cyan, magenta, and yellow can also be considered as primary colors. This is because when these colors are combined, they produce a neutral or black color. The difference between the two sets of primary colors lies in the way they interact with light: additive color mixing combines light to create new colors, while subtractive color mixing combines pigments or dyes to absorb and reflect certain wavelengths of light.

In summary, there are indeed two different sets of primary colors, but they apply to different contexts and methods of creating and perceiving color.
