contains_question: yes

question_part: I cannot find the 200k number you've listed for ChatDoctor dataset here, or the 215k you've listed on your github, only 100k in their paper, or 100k+10k+5k on their github. Is their dataset actually only 200k/215k and they just listed it wrong? Is this not actually their dataset, and your dataset are responses generated by ChatDoctor? Is this just an error on your part?
