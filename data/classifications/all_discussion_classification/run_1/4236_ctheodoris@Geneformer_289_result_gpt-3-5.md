question_part: 
With transcriptomic data (bulk RNAseq) and clinical data, I would like to implement the function of gene dosage sensitivity prediction, but I don't know how to convert the transcriptomic data and clinical data into the input file of the code named "gene_classification.ipynb" which was shared in the Huggingface(https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/tree/main/examples). Could you please tell me how to solve this problem? The file format of the transcriptomic and clinical data was shown in the attachment.
