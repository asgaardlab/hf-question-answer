contains_question: yes

question_part: While the model was loading, I encountered a "session crashed" message due to Google Colab running out of memory. I am writing to ask if anyone has suggestions for possible workarounds that would allow me to run this model within Google Colab, or if there are alternative approaches to loading the model that would be more feasible given the resource constraints of Colab.
