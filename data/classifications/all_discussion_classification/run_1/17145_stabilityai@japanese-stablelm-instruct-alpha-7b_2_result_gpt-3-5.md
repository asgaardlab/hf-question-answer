contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm trying to run this locally via oobabooga, but I get an error that it's trying to access a gated repo (here, which I've gained access to).  As I have the model downloaded it shouldn't need to access a repo.  Is there a way I can update the config or other files to run everything offline?  Thanks.
