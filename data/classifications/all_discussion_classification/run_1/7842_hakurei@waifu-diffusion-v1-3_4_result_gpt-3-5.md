contains_question: yes

question_part: Can you please explain how i should load the ckpt models? My first error was that 'revision fp16 does not exist'. Next it started to download all the ckpt epochs and I  don't have that much space! E.g. should I download all the epochs or only the last epoch? How do I load fp16 now that revision arg is not working?
