contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Everytime I use the Unified Canvas in InvokeAI with OpenJourney it starts to produce this tiled effect as seen in the bottom of the image. The first render works fine but when I try extending the image it always starts tiling. I have tried with multiple different prompts and setting but it always produces the same tiling results. 

Does Openjourney lack the ability to work with inpainting or am I missing something?
