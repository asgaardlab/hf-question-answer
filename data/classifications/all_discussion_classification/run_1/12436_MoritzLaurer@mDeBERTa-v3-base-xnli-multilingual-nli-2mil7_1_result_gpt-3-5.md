contains_question: yes

question_part: What is the maximum number of predictable classes and how to do fine tune? What is the confidence with which it predicts the Italian language? However, having a very high number of classes in the order of hundreds, what advice could you give me? Is it the case to do fine-tune for such a high number of classes? If so, how can I do it?
