question_part: "AMD GPU behaviour?
I appreciate that this has only been tested on Nvidia, but I have an AMD 7800XT and am getting really weird results with any GPU offload enabled. The text is barely related to the instruction and makes bizarre diversions. It works fine on CPU.
I'm using LM Studio on Windows. Is anyone else experiencing this or do you have any hints? Thanks"
