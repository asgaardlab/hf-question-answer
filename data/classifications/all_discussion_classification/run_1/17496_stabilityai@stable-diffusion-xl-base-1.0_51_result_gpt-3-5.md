contains_question: yes
question_part: I was wondering if it is possible to use the "style_preset" as in Dreamstudio or StabilityAI API (https://platform.stability.ai/docs/api-reference#tag/v1generation/operation/textToImage). Can it be done by simply including/ appending the style preset to the prompt?
