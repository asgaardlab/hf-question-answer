contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm using it with KoboldAI, and am wondering what the best approach is to get it to write stories at length.  I've never used an instruct model before, and I'm not sure of the best way to prompt it in KoboldAI to facilitate that.   It always seems to want to wrap the story up.  I'm also not entirely certain what the best pracftice is for having KoboldAI insert those #### instruction blocks automatically (out of band).
