contains_question: yes

question_part: Interesting idea, have you considered other models like: Starling-LM-7B-alpha, Chupacabra-v3, Zephyr-7b-beta and OpenChat-3.5? Maybe a Frankenmerge between these Six models (including these two over here OpenHermes-2.5 and Neural-Chat-3.1) resulting in 3 different 11B models, then merging all three with Dare_Ties. Also, could you upload the Q8_0 GGUF? Thank you in advance.
