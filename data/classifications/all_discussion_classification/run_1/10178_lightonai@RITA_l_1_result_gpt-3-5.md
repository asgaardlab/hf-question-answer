contains_question: yes

question_part: I tried to fine tune RITA using Huggingface's run_clm.py script but got an error of "Loading lightonai/RITA_l requires you to execute the configuration file in that repo on your local machine. Make sure you have read the code there to avoid malicious use, then set the option `trust_remote_code=True` to remove this error."
