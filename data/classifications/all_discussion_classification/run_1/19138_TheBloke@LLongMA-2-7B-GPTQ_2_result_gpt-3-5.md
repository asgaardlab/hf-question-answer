contains_question: yes

question_part: Can I use this model for my own purposes if my Core i7-6700 computer has 16 GB RAM and integrated video. Maybe I'm not making the right settings or I don't have the right hardware, so I get the error "RuntimeError: [enforce failed at ..\c10\core\impl\alloc_cpu.cpp:72] data. DefaultCPUAllocator: not enough memory: you tried to allocate 67108864 bytes."
Can you tell me if this model or another one will work for me to generate text by prompts?
