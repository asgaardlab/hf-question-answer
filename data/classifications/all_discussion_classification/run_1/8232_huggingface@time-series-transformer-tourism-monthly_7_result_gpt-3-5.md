contains_question: yes

question_part: I was wondering if it's possible to use this model to make predictions for a "gap" in the data, i.e., feeding the values before and after and predicting the missing interval. I suppose that maybe the observed mask can play a role to achieve this, but I am not entirely certain if it's possible.
