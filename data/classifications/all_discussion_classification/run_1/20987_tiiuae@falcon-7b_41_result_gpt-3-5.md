contains_question: yes

question_part: I successfully finetuned the falcon-7b and pushed it to the hub. However, the HF inference API isn't working.. I get this error "Loading medmac01/moroccan-qa-falcon-7b requires you to execute the configuration file in that repo on your local machine. Make sure you have read the code there to avoid malicious use, then set the option `trust_remote_code=True` to remove this error."
