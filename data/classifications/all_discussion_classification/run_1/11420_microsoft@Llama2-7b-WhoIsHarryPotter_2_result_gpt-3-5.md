contains_question: yes

question_part: I can't find the Github link claimed in the paper. Do the authors plan to release the code?
In addition, is there any plan to release the (completion-based and token-probability-based) prompts used in the evaluation?
How is the "300-word long chunk" used in Figure 11? What's meant by " followed by a list of hand-curated examples"?
Do you need to manually write examples to show how to create prompts based on the 300-word original text chunk?
