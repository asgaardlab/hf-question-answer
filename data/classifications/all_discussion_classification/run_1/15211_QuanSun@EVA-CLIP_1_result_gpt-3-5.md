contains_question: yes
question_part: The models seem very promising and I would love to use them! However, the checkpoints are not paired with their configs, and not individually pushed to the hub at the moment, which makes it harder to get access to them. Let me know if I can help you to have them pushed on the hub or if they are already somewhere I'm not aware of.
