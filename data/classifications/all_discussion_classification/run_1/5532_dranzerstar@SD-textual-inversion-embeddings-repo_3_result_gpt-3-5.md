contains_question: yes

question_part: Please forgive my stupid question, I wonder what is the "respective LoRa net" mentioned in the README.md and how to use it in a text-to-image generation. If I just activate the Lora in the positive prompt like <<lora:****:1>>, the result will not reproduce an accurate character figure. Maybe I need some additional prompts or just bad luck? Could you please upload a picture of the character Lora with generation data for me to have a reference?
