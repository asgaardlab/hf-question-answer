contains_question: yes  
question_part: Hi, could you please inform me about the learning rate used during the training phase of the ORCA-2 models? I am looking to adjust the learning rate appropriately for fine-tuning tasks, aiming to enhance performance by referencing the learning rate employed in ORCA-2's training. These parameters are not revealed in the arxiv paper. Thank you so much.
