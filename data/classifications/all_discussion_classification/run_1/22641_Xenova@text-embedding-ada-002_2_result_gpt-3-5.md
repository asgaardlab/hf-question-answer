contains_question: yes

question_part: When running the code example of the model card `tokenizer = GPT2TokenizerFast.from_pretrained('Xenova/text-embedding-ada-002')`, it display the following message: "The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is not the same type as the class this function is called from. It may result in unexpected tokenization. The tokenizer class you load from this checkpoint is 'GPT4Tokenizer'. The class this function is called from is 'GPT2TokenizerFast'." Is the warning message above matters
