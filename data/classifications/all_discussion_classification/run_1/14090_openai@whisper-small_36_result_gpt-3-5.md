contains_question: yes

question_part: I am wondering if the Whisper has a WhisperProcessorWithLm or hot words boosting method that I can use? Like the following API: [Wav2vec2ProcessorWithLm](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/wav2vec2#transformers.Wav2Vec2ProcessorWithLM). I don't know if the WhisperTokenizer can do the same ?
