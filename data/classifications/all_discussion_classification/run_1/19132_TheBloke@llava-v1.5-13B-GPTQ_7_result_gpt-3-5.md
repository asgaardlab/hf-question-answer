contains_question: yes
question_part: However, with this model, the output is just arbitrary. If you set temperature to 0.1 it always outputs Abraham Lincoln, no matter what image. If you set it to 0.7 as suggested in the model card, it varies a lot, but there is no connection between the output and the pictures. Not even woman and man are correct, nor black and white people.  Something went completely wrong here.
