contains_question: yes

question_part: Unfortunately, I seem to be hitting a wall trying to install the AI.
No idea what it means or what I'm supposed to do about it. Tried messing around with the start-webui parameters as suggested various places (e.g. --gpu-memory and --pre_layer etc.), but it has no effect at all, always the same error and traceback files. Wondering if the install itself is messed up somehow, so maybe I'll have to download and install everything from scratch again?
Any help or tips is welcome, and thank you in advance.
