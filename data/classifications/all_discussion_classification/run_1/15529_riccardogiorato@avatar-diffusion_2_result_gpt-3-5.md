contains_question: yes

question_part: Hello, I love your template, the result is great but I think that with many more images it could be even better, I would like to contribute to add images - I can make a lot of avatar captures 1 I have pictures of the 2 what is the format to respect (type of file, sizes, break of characters) etc etc .... one of the main problem I found is that the na'vi do not have a tail, we must be able to remedy this ...
