contains_question: yes  
question_part: Hi i see that you have provided the data for the bivalent chromatin example. Will you also be provided the example code for it to reproduce the paper's results? Did you fine tune separately for bivalent vs lys4 only, and bivalent vs no methylation, in effect creating two separate models or did you adjust Geneformer to do multiclass prediction to incorporate all three classes?
