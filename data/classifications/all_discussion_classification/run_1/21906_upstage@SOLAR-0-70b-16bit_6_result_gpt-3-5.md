contains_question: yes

question_part: They also had an almost completely identical model card to this one until i asked about the model card and benchmark scores. After asking they changed the model card and told me that they trained on instruct-v1, after that i told them once again that its a bit too suspicious that the scores are the same, down to the decimals and they completely removed their model discussion page.
