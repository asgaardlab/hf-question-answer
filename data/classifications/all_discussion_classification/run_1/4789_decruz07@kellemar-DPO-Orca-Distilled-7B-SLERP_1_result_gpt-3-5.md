contains_question: yes
question_part: Congratulations on the breakthrough you've acheieved with model merging! I'd like to ask you some questions. Did you fine-tune the model after merging it, or was it not fine-tuned? If you fine-tuned the model, did you consider the difference between fine-tuning after merging and fine-tuning the base model directly?
