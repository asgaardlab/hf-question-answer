contains_question: yes

question_part: Just wondering if it's possible to fine tune your starcoder base to specialise at a particular language which is niche, and as far as I can tell not in the training data. In particular, do I just use this (https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/blob/main/finetune/finetune.py) as a starting point? My understanding is since coding languages are all related, they all have a common intermediate representation (give or take).
