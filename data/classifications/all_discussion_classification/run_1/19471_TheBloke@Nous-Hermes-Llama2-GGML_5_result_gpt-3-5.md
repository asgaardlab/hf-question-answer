contains_question: yes

question_part: When I ask questions like who played Alan Harper's ex-wife on Two and a Half Men it gives a way off base answer ("Conchita portrayed by Rose McGovern"). The two possible answers are Marin Hinkle (Judith) and April Bowlby (Kandi). Then when I ask it to try again it said Rose (a non-wife character), and so on as I pressed it. Almost every question I ask, such as who sang a particular song, or what song included this lyric, resulted in a hallucination.
