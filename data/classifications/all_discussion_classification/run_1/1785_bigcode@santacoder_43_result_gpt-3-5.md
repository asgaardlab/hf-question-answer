contains_question: yes

question_part: Which dataset between [The Stack (v1.1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack/tree/v1.1) and [The Stack Dedup (v1.1)](https://huggingface.co/datasets/bigcode/the-stack-dedup/tree/v1.1) was used to train SantaCoder?
The SantaCoder repo links to the former but can this be confirmed?
