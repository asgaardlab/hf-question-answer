contains_question: yes

question_part: Reasons for using two stage training, why first training with resolution of 384 instead of 1024? What is the reason for using 384 resolution training in stage 1, why not just training with resolution of 1024 for 40,000 steps? Is there any ablation study or experiment report show that two stage training is necessary?
