contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. In zero-shot, this model looks like an instruct model. However, when I put it into a role-play preset, it continues the conversation well. Is this an instruct -finetuned model?
2. I tested Chinese role-play as well, the model generates gorgeous Chinese words. I have never seen such wonderful output, not even from a 34B+ models. Did you build your own high-quality datasets?
