contains_question: yes
question_part: I would like to know if there is a way to train zephyr-7b on a local machine with more or less simple data. For example if there is a website with a store (2k - 10k Links (inc. sublinks) I would like to soak the knowledge up and put it inside this AI to make it to an expert for this Store - is there any way to archive this?
At the moment it feels VERY difficult to do that.
Can someone pls gimme a hug to get a blink of the knowledge I need to get closer to a solution here?
