contains_question: yes

question_part: I get a "Error: Given groups=1, weight of size [16, 6, 3, 3], expected input[1, 3, 512, 512] to have 6 channels, but got 3 channels instead. Please, check your schedules/ init values." error when I apply this CN.  Looking at the Deforum discord, I see others have had issues w/ Comfy, e.g, "Comfy gives an error about the wrong aspect ratio. I changed differently, but it does not work."  Is there something specific or beyond a typical implementation that I need to look at for this to work, or maybe certain options that must be enabled?
