contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. Do anyone have examples of how to run speech enhancement?
2. Is there a way to do the opposite, basically *remove* speech? I can imagine running speech enhancement and then simply using phase cancellation to subtract it from the non-speech, but maybe there are better ways?
