contains_question: yes
question_part: Has anyone trained the model for a language not currently supported? I have a few (german, Russian, polish, ukranian, greek, korean) I'd like to train it for (3B model) and would like to know what it would take. 
I'd prefer just to do option 2.... but that might not be sufficient. Would love any insights others have had
