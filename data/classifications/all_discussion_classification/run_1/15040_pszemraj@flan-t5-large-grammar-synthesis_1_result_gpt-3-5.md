contains_question: yes

question_part: I absolutely love that this model can actually handle things longer than one sentence. Would there be any way to increase the total amount of input-text it can handle when using it in google colab so that it can process a multi-paragraph document of up to 2000 words (or 10,000 characters) or so?
