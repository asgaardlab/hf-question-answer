contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- is it possible to have controlnet only influence the result of part of an SD image gen? example: i want to define the position of a volleyball using a depth map, but i dont want to define the depth of the rest of the picture and have it be drawn "freely" instead. is there a way to do this by defining areas to ignore (zero control weight)? that would be extremely useful.
- is it possible to define a person's body shape with open pose without actually defining the exact pose in the picture? that also would be very useful to get the character look you want without depending completely on randomness or drastically limiting the possible outcome when you dont want to.
