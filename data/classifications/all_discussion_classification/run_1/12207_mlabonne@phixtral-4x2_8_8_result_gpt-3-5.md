contains_question: yes

question_part: So, I would like to ask how you took these points into consideration when creating phixtral. Additionally, I found NeuralMarcoro, which uses model-merging, very interesting, and I am also curious about the impact of differences in prompt templates between base models in terms of model merging rather than MoE.
