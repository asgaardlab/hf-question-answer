contains_question: yes
question_part: You provided two different fine tunes for 13B, both are very differently named (one pretrained vicuna, and this one). The readme lists less training data for the vicuna upload, the configuration shows "square" as aspect ratio, does that mean the image is cropped to square instead of padding in this case? 
What is the purpose of the other finetune?
