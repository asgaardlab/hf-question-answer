contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I would like to use the pytorch_model.bin file in Whisper, but it seems the model it used is called large-v2.pt. I wonder how do I convert this so that it can be used in Whisper installation?
If I want to use both, how do i convert pytorch_model.bin into format that whisper-cpp and OpenAI whisper to use?
