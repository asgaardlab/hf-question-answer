contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- On MacOS, The "Share" option (over images) crashes the app, the tooltip menu reopens itself indefinitely  until it crashes.
From the collection also, the share freezes the app and crash.
Unfortunate when using Shortcuts from inside the app, I must "reveal in finder", then apply the script, I'm not sure if it is just me.
