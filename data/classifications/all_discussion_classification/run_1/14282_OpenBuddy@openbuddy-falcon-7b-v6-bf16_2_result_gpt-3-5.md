contains_question: yes

question_part: Falcon is significantly better in non-english than llama-70B. Even Falcon 7B can beat it in grammar. Should not be a big thing to include the small falcon model to your latest updates. Did you evaluate chinese in Falcon vs llama? With european languages Falcon beats even the largest llamas.
