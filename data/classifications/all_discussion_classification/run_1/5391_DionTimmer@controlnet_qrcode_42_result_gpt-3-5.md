contains_question: yes

question_part: It would be really great if your examples could be expanded to show the raw input images (qr code + style image ), the prompt, and the settings used, to generate the output image. Your example code uses images which are in S3, which are unavailable for the public to view. In the same vain, it seems to me like this is best for blending the two input images together, I have yet to see how the prompt really improves things, so potentially examples could help there.
