contains_question: yes
question_part: I wonder if there are any plans to produce an 8bit (quantized) version of GPT-JT, as was done for the original GPT-J in [hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit](https://huggingface.co/hivemind/gpt-j-6B-8bit). Could address steep hardware requirements as in [discussion #9](https://huggingface.co/togethercomputer/GPT-JT-6B-v1/discussions/9).
