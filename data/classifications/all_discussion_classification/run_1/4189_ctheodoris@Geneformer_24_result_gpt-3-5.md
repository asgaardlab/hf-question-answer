contains_question: yes
question_part: I was looking at the list of datasets (Supplementary Table 1) and noticed that a substantial fraction of datasets was listed multiple times (presumably because the same data was hosted on multiple resources: HCA/GEO/Cellxgene, etc). So, perhaps, the actual number of unique cells was less than 27M. Could you, please, confirm if this is indeed the case and whether you tested the impact of these duplications on the model performance? Thank you in advance!
