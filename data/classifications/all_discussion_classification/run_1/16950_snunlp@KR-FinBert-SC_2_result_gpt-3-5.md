contains_question: yes

question_part: Regarding the pre-training of the model to align with the finance domain, it is mentioned that the "reports issued by securities analysts" are included in the training data. I'm curious about the period during which the data for these reports was collected. I'm also interested in knowing the timeframe for the collection of financial news data used in the pre-training of the model.
