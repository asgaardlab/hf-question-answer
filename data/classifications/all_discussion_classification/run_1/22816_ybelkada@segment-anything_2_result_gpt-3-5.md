contains_question: yes

question_part: from my understanding, it appears that HuggingFace does not currently offer an 'Inference API" for model which I believe is effectively a way to prototype with this model in a light weight way without (eg) having to install a bunch of random CUDA drivers and pip libraries

Are there any plans to offer an inference API for this model if my understanding that this does not currently exist is correct?
