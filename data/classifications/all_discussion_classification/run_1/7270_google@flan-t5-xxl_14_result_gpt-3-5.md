contains_question: yes

question_part: Unfortunately, when invoking the endpoint I get a `PredictionException` which says: `Could not load model /.sagemaker/mms/models/google__flan-t5-xxl with any of the following classes: (transformers.models.auto.modeling_auto.AutoModelForSeqZSeqLMu0027, transformers.models.t5.modeling_t5.T5ForConditionalGeneration).`

Has anyone had this issue or, even better, been able to deploy and use this model via SageMaker?
