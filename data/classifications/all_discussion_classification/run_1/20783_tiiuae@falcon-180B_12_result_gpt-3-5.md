contains_question: yes
question_part: 
Can I use Falcon 180B to generate a large training dataset of JSON prompts and answers, then train and distribute a new model with Apache 2.0?
Then can I use that dataset to train a new model?
Like hosting it as a service or using it in a company?
So does license allow it?
