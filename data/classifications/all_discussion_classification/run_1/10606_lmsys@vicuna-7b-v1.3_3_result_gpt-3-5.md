contains_question: yes

question_part: I just ran into the issue "OSError: lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 does not appear to have a file named config.json" when I am trying to load the pre-trained model using `AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3")`
The transformers version I am using is 4.33.3. I was able to load it appropriately yesterday. But somehow it suddenly failed today. 

Could you help me with this? Thank you!
