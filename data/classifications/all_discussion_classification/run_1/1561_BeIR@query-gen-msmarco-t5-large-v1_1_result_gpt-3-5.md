contains_question: yes

question_part: I am wondering about the training script and training arguments used for this model card, such as: * T5 initial checkpoint, * maximum source/target length, * batch size, * optimizer, * learning rate, * learning rate scheduling, * warmup steps, * and total training steps. Did you use the same training script and arguments used in [doc2query/msmarco-t5-base-v1](https://huggingface.co/doc2query/msmarco-t5-base-v1/blob/main/train_script.py)?
