contains_question: yes
question_part: If i Ask questions like 'what is the size of a uint8' i get a Line of code as an answer that declares a uint8. Thé question is in thé train dataset in plain english, but i get lines of codes. If i ask for some code with a description, i don't get the description, even if thé description and thé code are part of thé dataset. Am i doing something incorrectly ?
