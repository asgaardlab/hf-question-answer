contains_question: yes
question_part: In this case, I see that a [Waxy article](https://waxy.org/2022/11/invasive-diffusion-how-one-unwilling-illustrator-found-herself-turned-into-an-ai-model/) includes comments from both yourself and the artist on the model trained on their images. It looks like you've already edited the model card to address some of the artist's concerns, would you be open to also add a link to the article.
