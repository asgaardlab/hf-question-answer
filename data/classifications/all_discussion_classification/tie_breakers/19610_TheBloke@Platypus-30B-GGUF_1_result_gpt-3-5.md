contains_question: yes
question_part: The 8-bit version of the download seems to stop at 31.7GB, I tried from 2 public-wifi sites, to complete. I am on linux-mint 20, using, waterfox &  firefox, its all up-to-date. In other words, it wont complete in the last 500MB. I have been trying to get this file for over 5 weeks, and it is a critical download, that I will not be able to attempt again. I have paused and resumed multiple times, it just stops then fails, retrying does exactly the same.
