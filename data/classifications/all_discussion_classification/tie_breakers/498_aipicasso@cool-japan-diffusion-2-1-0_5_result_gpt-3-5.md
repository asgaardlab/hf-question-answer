contains_question: yes
question_part: Microsoft Defender is flagging this model as containing Win32 Trojan Sirefef. It might be a false positive, as it happened before with other models, but pickle scanner returned an error while scanning, and it has no pickle flag here on HF. Please convert it to Safetensor and double check the upload, as I'm sure the guys behind the model worked really hard to make it available to the community.
