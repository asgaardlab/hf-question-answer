question_part:
1:07 How to install the LoRA extension to the Stable Diffusion Web UI
2:54 How to crop images using Paint .NET, an open-source image editing software
5:02 What is Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)
9:09 Save checkpoints frequency
10:04 What is batch size in training settings
15:55 What is Class and Sample Image Prompt in SD training
17:57 What is Image Generation settings and why we need classification image generation in SD training
21:03 How and why to tune your Class Prompt (generating generic training images)
22:39 Why we generate regularization generic images by class prompt
29:23 How much GPU, CPU, and RAM the class regularization image generation uses
30:04 Displaying the generated class regularization images folder for SD 2.1
31:19 Where LoRA training checkpoints (weights) are saved
33:10 When we will decide to stop training
34:09 How to resume training after training has crashed or you close it down
39:25 Results after 5600 steps (350 epochs) - it was sufficient for SD 2.1
39:44 How I'm picking a checkpoint to generate a full model .ckpt file
40:23 How to generate a full model .ckpt file from a LoRA checkpoint .pt file
42:01 Doing inference (generating new images) using the text2img tab with our newly trained and generated model
44:38 Setting up the training parameters/options for SD version 1.5 this time
49:11 Displaying the generated class regularization images folder for SD 1.5
50:16 Training of Stable Diffusion 1.5 using the LoRA methodology and teaching a face has been completed and the results are displayed
51:19 You have to do more inference with LoRA since it has less precision than DreamBooth
52:51 How to generate more than 100 images using the script section of the Web UI
