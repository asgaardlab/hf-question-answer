contains_question: yes
question_part: Hi all,
I am a newbie - so I would like to generate an inference Endpoint with this model, but everytime I try doing that I get an error saying that the repo doesn't have a "handler.py" file hence it won't work. I know that I can create my own custom "handler.py" file, but when I do I get all sort of errors in the repo - mainly is because I am not sure how to include all other pytorch bin files that are needed in the repo.
