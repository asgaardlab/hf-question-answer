contains_question: yes

question_part: It would be great if you can add widget examples in the model card so that users can see sample generations given a prompt. You can [find here](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-34B/discussions/17) how widget examples were added for [01-ai/Yi-34B](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-34B). If you encounter any questions, please let me know :)
