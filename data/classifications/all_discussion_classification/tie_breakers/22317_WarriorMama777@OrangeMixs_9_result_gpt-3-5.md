contains_question: yes

question_part: When using AbyssOrangeMix2 for inpantingï¼Œthe result seems to be strange. Even if I set "Denoising strength = 0", the color of masked parts still look obviously different from the other parts. The same issue then appears when I use BasilMix for inpanting. So I guess the issue of AbyssOrangeMix2 comes from BasilMix, but I don't know what it is.
