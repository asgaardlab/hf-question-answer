contains_question: yes
question_part: today i found out it's gone? I used to use the diffusion branch of this repo but when I came to this repo today (with the README empty and only a couple commits) , I'm not getting the same results from the main branch of this repo. Can anyone explain to me what happened and if there's a way to get back the old anything v3 (like the one a week back)
