contains_question: yes

question_part: I imagine, if you’re replicating the Llama project, that OpenLLama is multilingual (that’s one of the key reasons why people is using LLama: it’s not only usable in English), could you please confirm this? 
I would also like to know about the Spanish corpora used for pre-training.
