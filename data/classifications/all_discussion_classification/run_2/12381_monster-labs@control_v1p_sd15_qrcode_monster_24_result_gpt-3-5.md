contains_question: yes
question_part: I've been experimenting with node setups to push this model further and had an additional question about having good foundations to get optimal results with this. The grey background (#808080) you mentioned in the model card. Is that meant as a replacement for the non-module palette color (normally white) for the QR that is fed into the controlnet input, or is that a color to use for any area outside the square bounds of the entire code? Since the training process does not have much info, the current description leaves some ambiguity. I do know from small tests that if I make a dual color QR with #000000 and #808080 in a simple setup without using a qr img to img starting point, it won't be scannable even when cranking up the controlnet strength to 10. But it works fine with the #FFFFFFF non module color. Was my initial interpretation completely wrong (and the input should consist of white+black and grey on the outside) or was it a recommendation to enhance greater QR contrast flexibility (with the assumption that img2img will also be used)?
