contains_question: yes
question_part: Sorry if is a bad question - or rude to ask, (or even taboo?) but where do I find information on how to actually install OpenDalle on PC? Been reading the forums that I can find on this topic and haven't found anything really clear-cut. Have the files - just unsure how to get it all working.

Or is this a much larger and more complicated process than it seems on the surface? Appreciate any help. Thanks.
