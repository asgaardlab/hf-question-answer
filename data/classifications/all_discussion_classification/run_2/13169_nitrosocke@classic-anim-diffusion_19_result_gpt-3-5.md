contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi there. The eyes especially are all scrambled looking. But the mouth as well. The teeth are just one white block. I tried to add some negative prompts such as fuses eyes and fused teeth, but it's always a hot mess. Not sure what prompts I can use to prevent this. EDIT: I also tried adding the prompts closed eyes and closed mouth, hoping this would solve the problem. However, it doesn't even obey these prompts. Might be worth looking into.
