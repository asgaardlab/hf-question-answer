## https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet-v1-1/discussions/8

contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, with the previous release each model had its repository and we could do `ControlNetModel.from_pretrained("lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-hed", file='', torch_dtype=torch.float16)` Is there an alternative API for these models?
