contains_question: yes

question_part: Thanks for such a great work. Could you please specify how to locate input data to hyperparameter optimization demo in Genecorpus-30M repo? Is it the same as the input data for in silico perturbation analysis demo(human_dcm_hcm_nf.dataset
)? If we want to adapt this pipeline to our own scRNA seq data, do you have any recommendation of how to prepare the input data? Specifically, if DEG is needed to identify disease state per cell? And how  could we derive "length of that cell's rank value encoding" information?
