contains_question: yes

question_part: Okay, I cannot figure out what, or what not, I may be doing to cause this, but when I start a conversation, after a while, the Vicuna model starts pausing. I can try to press continue, but it will only continue with one word, and then end up pausing again. Is there any way that I can fix this? Thanks for the help.
