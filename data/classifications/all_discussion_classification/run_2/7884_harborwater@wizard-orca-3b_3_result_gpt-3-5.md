contains_question: yes

question_part: So, as there is only ONE 3b version of Llama, and i was able to convert this thing here with a Llama converter script, this Model too must be an OpenLlama descendant, isn't it?
I refer to this model as an OpenLlama descendant, and I would like to have a confirmation if that is correct?
