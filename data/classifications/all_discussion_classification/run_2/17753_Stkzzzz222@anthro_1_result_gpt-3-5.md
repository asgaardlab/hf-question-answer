contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- May I ask you some information about your training? Your results are so good, I'm also trying to train embedding but my results are lackluster at best. So, I'll start with the questions
- 1. How many vector did you use and what was your initialization text?
- 2. How many samples did you run the training for?
- 3. What type of images did you use in your training data?
