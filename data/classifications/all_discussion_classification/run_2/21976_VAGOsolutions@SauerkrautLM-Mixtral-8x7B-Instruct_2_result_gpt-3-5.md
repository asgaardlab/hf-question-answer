But, I am having a hard time getting the model to work for instruction tasks which require specific formatting. It refuses to output JUST the required information that I need. It has a very large tendency to continue generating extra info and notes about it's answer.

Any ideas for what are the best prompting techniques for this model specifically? Does it really require few-shot examples even for these simple tasks?
