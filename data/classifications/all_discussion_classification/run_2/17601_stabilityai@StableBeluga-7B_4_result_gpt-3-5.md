contains_question: yes
question_part: I install all the required dependencies and try to run the example, but constantly get this error: "OSError: stabilityai/StableBeluga-7B does not appear to have a file named pytorch_model.bin, tf_model.h5, model.ckpt or flax_model.msgpack." It never seems to attempt to download the model and just hangs here. Any suggestions?
