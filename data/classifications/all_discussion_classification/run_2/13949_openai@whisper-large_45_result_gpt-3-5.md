contains_question: yes
question_part: I am exploring the possibilities of using advanced machine learning models, like OpenAI's Whisper large model, in iOS and macOS applications. However, I'm facing a challenge as there are no readily available .mlmodel files that suit my needs. Could anyone guide me on how to generate a .mlmodel file from scratch or convert existing models to be compatible with Apple's CoreML framework? Specifically, I'm interested in steps, tools, or libraries necessary for this conversion process. Additionally, any tips on optimizing these models for better performance on Apple devices would be greatly appreciated. I am looking for advice from those who have experience in this area or know relevant resources.
