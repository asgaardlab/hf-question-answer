contains_question: yes

question_part: Hey there, I’m here to ask you if we could collaborate together to integrate Pygmalion into an AI platform I’m making where users can create AIs of all types (not only Pygmalion characters) for free and  with no code or advanced knowledge requiered and then share or sell them with even a free API they can use on their own websites or apps. That will mean users won’t need to self host Pygmalion if they don’t want to use Colab or spend money on paid GPU/CPU/IPU, want it running 24/7 or want to integrate it as a Discord chatbot or any other thing What do you think about helping with me with this?
