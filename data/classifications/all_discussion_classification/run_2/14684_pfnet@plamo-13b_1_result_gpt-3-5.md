contains_question: yes

question_part: The error you're encountering, TypeError: 'type' object is not subscriptable, usually occurs in Python when you're trying to subscript a type object which doesn't support indexing or subscripting. This error commonly happens in Python versions below 3.9 when trying to use the built-in dict or list types as subscriptable types, as in Python 3.9+.
