contains_question: yes

question_part: I have been transcribing some audios (30 second long) and for some of them the output is just the first word (something like: ' the'). I have change the script and tried with different models (whisper-medium) and with that one seems to work... When it works it is just perfect but sometimes it doesn't transcribe anything for me. Any thoughts on how to solve or overcome this
