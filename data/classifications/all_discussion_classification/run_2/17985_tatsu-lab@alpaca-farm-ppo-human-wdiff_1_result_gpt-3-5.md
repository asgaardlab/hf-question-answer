contains_question: yes
question_part: This isn't a big issue, but the tokenizer isn't present in this repo, so running the recover_model_weights.py script from alpaca_farm with ppo-human fails because it doesn't find the tokenizer (although I assume it's the same as the tokenizers for the other models)
