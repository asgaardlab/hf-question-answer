contains_question: yes

question_part:
1. Clone the dolly repo to a directory on the VM/Databricks filesystem?
  - I don't see "the model" in [your repo here](https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly) (I'm probably missing something fundamental here!)
  - Do I need to download it to the VM/Databricks filesystem from somewhere else?
