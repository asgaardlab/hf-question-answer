contains_question: yes

question_part: Does this mean that, in order to use the derrida_final Checkpoint, we also need to load the autoencoder_fix_kl-f8-trinart_characters.ckpt via some script in the WebUI that loads separate first_stage_model parameters? If so, how is this done? From my looking at the popular WebUI, I couldn't find any settings to change the first_stage_model parameters.
