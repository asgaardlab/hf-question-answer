contains_question: yes

question_part: Ok so I want to specifically download the "Wizard-Vicuna-13B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q4_K_S.bin" model using hugging face's snapshot_download, when I do try to run it using the correct path, it gives me the error "repo_id must be in the form ....", and when I do provide it the repo id, as expected, it starts to download all the models, is there any way I can download only that one singular model ? What's would be the syntax for it?
