contains_question: yes
question_part: Can you use jailbreak prompt with KoboldAI as API on Janitor AI (I'm using Kobold AI API for Janitor AI) So I see the "This is added to OpenAI prompt to set the behaviour of the bot." so I was thinking if the jailbreak prompt could work the same with Kobold AI?
