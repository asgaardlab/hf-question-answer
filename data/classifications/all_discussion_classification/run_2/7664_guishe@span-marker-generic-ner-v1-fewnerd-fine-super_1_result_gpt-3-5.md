contains_question: yes

question_part: Just checking if the licence is correct and as intended. To my knowledge, NuMind is MIT licensed and Few-nerd is cc-by-sa-4.0 (which has specific limitations for changing licence after something is build upon the subject see - https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/deed.en). A number of times folks mix up cc-by-sa-4.0 and cc-by-nc-sa-4.0 so decided to check if that is the case.
