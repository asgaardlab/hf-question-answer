Problem # 1:
I can not change the position of the eyeballs. The position of the mouth (open or closed mouth) works, also works a change in the position of the head. I canâ€™t understand why the direction of gaze does not change. What could be the problem? I tried different settings.

Question #2:
Now I have a version of Mediapipe == 0.9.1.0, this is a current version?
