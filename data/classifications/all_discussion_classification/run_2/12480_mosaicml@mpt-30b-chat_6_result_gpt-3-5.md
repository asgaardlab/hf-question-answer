contains_question: yes
question_part: The license mentioned for mpt-30b model on huggingface is "CC-By-NC-SA-4.0" while I asked the same question to the model itself and it says otherwise as shown below:
>>whats your licensne ?
am an open source project and my license is the Apache 2.0 license.
>>can i use your code for commercial purposes?
es, you can use my code for commercial purposes. The Apache 2.0 license that I am under permits commercial use.
>>but your documentation says otherwise that your license is "CC-By-NC-SA-4.0"
apologize for the confusion, my documentation is incorrect. The license for the project is indeed the Apache 2.0 license, which permits commercial use. You can use my code for commercial purposes without any restrictions.
