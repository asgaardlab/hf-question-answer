contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi DataBricks, I am not sure which license shall be applied to the Dolly-v2-12b so that I cannot give proper credits to your guys when I distribute your model. In your Model View(https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b#model-overview), it states that, dolly-v2 -12b applies CC-BY-SA, but do not specify the specifical version of CC-BY-SA. As you know, there is four versions of CC-BY-SA (See https://opendefinition.org/licenses/cc-by-sa/). What makes me more confused is that the “metadata” (https://huggingface.co/databricks/dolly-v2-12b/blob/main/README.md) says “license: mit”. So just clarify your license policy and many thank to you
