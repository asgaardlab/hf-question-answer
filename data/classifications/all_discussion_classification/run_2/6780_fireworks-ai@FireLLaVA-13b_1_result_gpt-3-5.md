contains_question: yes

question_part: How can the model be commercial, if it is using OpenAI CLIP? I understand that as per convention, any checkpoints that used research/non-commercial models in the pipeline are also  considered to be non-commercial. Please, can you explain how your model checkpoint can be commercial or deployed for commercial/API use, while complying with the CLIP license? Or correct the claim of the model being commercial?
