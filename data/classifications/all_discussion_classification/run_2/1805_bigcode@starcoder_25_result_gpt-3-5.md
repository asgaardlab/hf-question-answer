contains_question: yes

question_part: When I was using it, I found that the effect of Code Completion Playground is much better than the offline prediction effect of the weight of the starcoder I downloaded. Why is this, and is there any difference? At the same time, the effect of Hosted inference API is not as good as that of Code Completion Playground. OK, does it do anything special?
