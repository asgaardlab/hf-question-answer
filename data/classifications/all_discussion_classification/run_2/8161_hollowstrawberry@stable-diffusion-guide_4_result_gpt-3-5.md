contains_question: yes

question_part: Hello so i followed all the steps for the google colab and no matter what i do the urls don't work or connect every time i use either the local it say it refuses to connect, or the public has a gateway timed out.  Can you please let me know if I need to uncheck any of the things that were checked when I copied to my drive or if there are additional steps I need to do with google colab I would very much appreciate it.
