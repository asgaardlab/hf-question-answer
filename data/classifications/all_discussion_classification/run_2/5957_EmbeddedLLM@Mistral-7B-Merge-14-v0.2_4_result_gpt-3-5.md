contains_question: yes

question_part: Your model card first mentioned at berkeley-nest/Starling-LM-7B-alpha, Q-bert/MetaMath-Cybertron-Starling, and janai-hq/trinity-v1 are problematic, but then they are all three part of the 14 models you mentioned as being part of this new model. Is it a typo? If that's correct, then the new version doesn't fix anything and should be removed from the HF Leading board.
