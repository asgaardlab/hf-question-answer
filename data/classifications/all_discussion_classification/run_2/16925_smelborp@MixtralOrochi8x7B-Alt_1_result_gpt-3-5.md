question_part: 
How is alt diffrent?
What is diffrent between the regular Orochi and the alt version? is it just a difference in the order of the models merged? Or something else?
Also is it possible to post benchmarks for these models? Id love to see this on open llm leaderboard if its not already, as well as some coding benchmarks like humaneval and humaneval+
Ive personally found the non alt version to be very good at coding
