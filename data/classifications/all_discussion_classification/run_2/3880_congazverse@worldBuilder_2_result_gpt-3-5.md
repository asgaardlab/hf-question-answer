contains_question: yes

question_part: I don't understand something, but it seems to me that the model doesn't work correctly. The result is not seamless and even your samples show that. Also, the image itself is not an equirectangular projection as if it were taken with a vr camera, although it is generated in a 2:1 aspect ratio. Straight lines look curved when viewed with a vr player.
