contains_question: yes
question_part: if prompted for a kid to get caught stealing a cookie other LLMs would simply say something like 'the door flung open'. However, this LLM keeps saying things like he heard foot steps coming up the hall as he looked at the plate of cookies, then moments later was startled and caught red-handed eating the cookies. And when I asked why, if he was supposed to get caught, you had him hear foot steps coming up the hall, Zephyr Beta says it's to build suspense.
