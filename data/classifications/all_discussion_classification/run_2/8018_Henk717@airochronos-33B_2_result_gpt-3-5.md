contains_question: yes

question_part: Hey, for KoboldAI (not lite) story writing, should I put an alpaca-format prompt in the memory box, or can I just write text in there? I'd assumed it was the latter, but I noticed in the description that you indicated it was tested for "regular story writing". Also, just out of curiosity, are "world info", etc. useful for any models other than KoboldAI's official models?
