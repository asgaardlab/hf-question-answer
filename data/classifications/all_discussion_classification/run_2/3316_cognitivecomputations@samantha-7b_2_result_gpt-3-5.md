contains_question: yes

question_part: Would you consider releasing the dataset?  I understand that you might consider this to be your "secret sauce" (e.g. even if the source dataset isn't proprietary, your curation of that dataset could be considered proprietary).  My hope is that you'll release the dataset so others can build on it.
