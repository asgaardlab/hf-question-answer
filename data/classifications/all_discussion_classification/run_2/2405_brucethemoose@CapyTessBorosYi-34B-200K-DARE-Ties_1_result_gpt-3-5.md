contains_question: yes

question_part: How did you get this to work without Yi's Tokenizer
I tried one other model (I forget which one, it's on the tip of my tongue) that was Yi-based that didn't include the tokenizer, and it put commas after every period, heh.  Whatever you did to get this to work, I'm interested so I could do the same.  Thanks.
