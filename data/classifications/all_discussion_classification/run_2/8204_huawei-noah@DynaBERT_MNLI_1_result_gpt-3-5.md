contains_question: yes
question_part: 
- Assuming I re-train it from scratch similarly to a typical BERT model, how can I can configure the width/depth weights?
- If I save/load the model, will the configuration for weights percist?
- Are we able to change the weights numerous times in the model object's lifetime, or is it done only once at initialization?
- Is there any specific API calls I need to make after training to generate the sub-set models, or are they generated on the fly during training?
