contains_question: yes

question_part: You mention a similar model trained with Alibi not working. I am wondering how you chose to implement Alibi for FIM. Ofir proposed multiple ways of adapting Alibi to FIM [here](https://github.com/ofirpress/attention_with_linear_biases/issues/5#issuecomment-1308319377), curious if you went with an implementation like those or something else
