contains_question: yes

question_part: However, there is a significant discrepancy between the Shift results I obtained and those in the DCM_del_tx worksheet of Supplementary Table 12. I also noticed that there is a large difference between the N_Detections and #_Detections in the results. For example, for the gene RYR2 (Gene_Token=17173, Ensembl_ID=ENSG00000198626), the N_Detections in my results was 29981, whereas in Table 12, the #_Detections was 9611. I understand that the paper may have selected a subset. So, I counted the number of times RYR2 appeared in different individuals with dcm among all cardiomyocytes (cell_type=Cardiomyocyte1/2/3 and disease=dcm):
