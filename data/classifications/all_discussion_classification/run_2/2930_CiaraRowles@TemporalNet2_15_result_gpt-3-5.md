contains_question: yes
question_part: Looking at the Deforum discord, I see others have had issues w/ Comfy, e.g, "Comfy gives an error about the wrong aspect ratio. I changed differently, but it does not work."  Is there something specific or beyond a typical implementation that I need to look at for this to work, or maybe certain options that must be enabled?
