contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I noticed that you guys also have a repo call "santacoder-megatron" (https://huggingface.co/bigcode/santacoder-megatron), where the files are more similar to other megatron-based repos. Therefore, I wonder to know what's the difference between this repo ("gpt_bigcode-santacoder") with "santacoder-megatron"
