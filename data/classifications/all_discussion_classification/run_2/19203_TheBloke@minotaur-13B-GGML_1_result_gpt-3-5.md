contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi. I am trying to use axolotl to train a model (I saw you did in the like model card) and I cannot figure out how to do it. Every time I try I get errors. Ive tried in deepnote and in google colab. The only time it worked was with open-llama-3b and it only worked once. Any tips? I read through their readme but  i dont know how to do it. I tried their quickstart thing but with Falcon and it didnt work.
