contains_question: yes

question_part: Is there an equivalent for PubMed (abstracts or full?)
I've scoured the internet thinking someone would have done this as a service to humanity, but apparently not. Given how many people have processed PubMed in various forms for LLMs, is there a legal or logistical reason why this hasn't been done yet?
