contains_question: yes

question_part: I get following error: 

``` 
...santacoder requires you to execute the configuration file in that repo on your local machine. Make sure you have read the code there to avoid malicious use, then set the option trust_remote_code\u003dTrue to remove this error 
``` 

What configuration file are they talking about? Or how can I set trust_remote_code when deploying via the `sagemaker.huggingface` sdk
