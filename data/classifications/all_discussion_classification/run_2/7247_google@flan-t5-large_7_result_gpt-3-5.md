contains_question: yes

question_part: Is this demo a joke? Look at these horrible results on all kinds of basic and promised tests. I wait to "test" AIs that come out and this comes out... Really? Is this even flan-t5? If it is, it must be the extra tiny ultra small pin size model, because no model should be this bad. What is this?
