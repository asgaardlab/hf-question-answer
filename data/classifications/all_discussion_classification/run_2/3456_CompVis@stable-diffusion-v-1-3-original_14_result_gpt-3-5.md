contains_question: yes

question_part: I keep seeing variations of this question: is it possible to create the same image as discord bot/DreamStudio when using the released weights? I realize that there may be some differences in hardware that cause indeterminant results. However, do DreamStudio and the discord bots run on the exact same hardware (perhaps so)? Has anyone come closer than this, and been able to attain identical images? More importantly, has anyone been able to attain the same level of "quality" as DreamStudio? Would love if the full set of defaults for the discord bots were revealed somewhere!
