contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. What is the correct way to structure the request for the Inference Endpoint when using image URLs?
2. Is there a step I might be overlooking that would account for the difference in behavior between the Interface API and the Inference Endpoint?
3. Has anyone successfully used the Inference Endpoint with image URLs, and if so, could you share an example request?
