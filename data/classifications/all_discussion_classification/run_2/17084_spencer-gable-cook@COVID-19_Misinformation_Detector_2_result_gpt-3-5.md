contains_question: yes

question_part: I read your technical report (https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QW9D6TN4KXX6poa6Q5L6FVgqaDQ4DxY9/view) â€“ great work!
Could you share some details of your fine-tuning process: 
- Which tweets exactly of the two datasets did you use (there are more than the 11707 samples you used)
- How did you preprocess the tweets? 
- What were your hyperparameters?
If you could share your Jypiter notebook that would be awesome!
Thank you, Damian
