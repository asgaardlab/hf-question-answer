contains_question: yes
question_part: How do we make a request? Result from inference API and inference endpoint are different
Can we please get an example of what is the expected input object?
It looks like it produces summary_text as output when given JSON of { inputs: "" }
whereas the inference API correctly gives the keywords.
How to make proper request in a self hosted environment? Thanks!
