contains_question: yes

question_part: This model seems to run faster than one trained on CFAR10, but ,judging by the architecture, CFAR10 model is lighter. Furtermore, during DDIM inversion and reconstruction CFAR10 manages to reproduce images better. What is the diffrence between these models, besides train data and architecture?
