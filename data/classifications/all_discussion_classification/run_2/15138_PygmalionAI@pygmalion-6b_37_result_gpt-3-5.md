contains_question: yes
question_part: Sometimes, in perhaps more edge cases, I'm getting `<BOT>:` prefixing generated responses rather than the name of the bot's character. Is this telling me something?
Along similar lines, is it effective to use "You" to indicate the user in the bot character's definition? For example, say the bot character is "Bob" and you put "Bob loves You" in the character definition. Does that have an effect in that the LM knows that "You" is the user?
