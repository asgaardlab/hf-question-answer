contains_question: yes

question_part: Is this ELECTRA model already pretrained?
On the GitHub repository says that to finetune a ELECTRA model I need to "get a pre-trained ELECTRA model either by training your own (see pre-training instructions above), or downloading the release ELECTRA weights and unziping them under $DATA_DIR/models". Is this the mentioned relaease with the weights? If not, is there any official pretrained version here in huggingface?
