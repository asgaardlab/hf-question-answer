contains_question: yes

question_part:  If I understand correctly, table 2 in the paper only displays the metrics for the two large models. can you also display the same metrics for this base sized model? 	table 2 only compares the large 335M instructor model with other smaller 111M models, which seems like an unfair comparison.
