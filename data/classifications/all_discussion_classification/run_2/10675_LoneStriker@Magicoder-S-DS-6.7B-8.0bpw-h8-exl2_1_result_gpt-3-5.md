contains_question: yes

question_part: I tried loading this from code with exllamav2, the same way I load other models, but it only generates gibberish. I then tried in text generation webui with exllamav2 and it's the same issue. When I use exllamav2_HF instead, it generates fine. How can I make this model work from my own code when using exllamav2
