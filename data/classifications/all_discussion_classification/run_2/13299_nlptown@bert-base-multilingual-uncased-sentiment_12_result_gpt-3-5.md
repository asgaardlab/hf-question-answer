question_part: Hi,

I have used optimum to convert this model to onnx format and am try to serve using model serving.  
When I directly use the model from local folder it works fine and gives logits but when I try to use api it doesn't work.

What is the data input I need to pass to the model when working using api (model serving). Where can I find the correct data to be provided.
