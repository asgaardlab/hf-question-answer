contains_question: yes

question_part: curious is this a coming project? or an idea out of grasp? im no programmer but between chat gpT, Vicuna, AutoGPT etc. im kinda interested in building something like this. Take look into GitHub and check the project PrivateGPT- u feed it documents, it ingest the data and a local (installed on ur computer not on the internet) ai model with remember the knowledge and answer questions based on it, with the Models previous knowledge in tact as well. all on a local system without internet access (after its setup of course). 

anyways im just another mechanic whos good by norime standars with a computer, can use arduinos etc. but desperate to get in on this bandwagon before it tramples us all.  thoughts?
