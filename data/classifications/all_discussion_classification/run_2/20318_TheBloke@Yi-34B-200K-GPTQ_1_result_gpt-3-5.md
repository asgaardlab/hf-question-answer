contains_question: yes

question_part: Model card states otherwise, so curious if I'm doing it wrong or if the card has an error in it. Thanks for the conversion. I know it's a new model, just curious what other people are doing and if this has the llama adaptations applied to it or if it's just a conversion of the Yi naming convention.
