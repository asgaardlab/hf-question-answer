question_part: 
I am trying to understand what the input data is, and I am getting confused.
What does the 2048 input size represent? I read it is 93% of rank value encodings, but I cannot understand how you get there.
Also, would it be possible to have a sample tokenized dataset available? I think a minimal working example would be helpful.
