contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm sorry if this is a very easy question, but I can't figure it out alone. How do you get the output for the analyzer? I mean, as a list or a tuple. I have tried many different things, but I can't get to handle correctly the output (its type is AnalyzerOutput) of the hate speech analysis to another function on my script.
