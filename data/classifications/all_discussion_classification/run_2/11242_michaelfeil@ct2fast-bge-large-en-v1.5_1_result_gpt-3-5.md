contains_question: yes

question_part: Do you mind sharing the commands that you used to convert this and other models on your huggingface account?  Some people might want to use Ctranslate2 to convert models and might not be as technically savvy as you are.  By the way, congrats on your projects with CT2 including infinity...impressive stuff, but seriously please try to make it easier for non-technical people like me.
