contains_question: yes
question_part: However, it was already pretty tough to make futanari characters with H16 and it is borderline impossible in H17.  I think it is because of the huge difference in quantity of training data?
Would it be reasonable to request an improvement on futanari usage?  Moreover, it would be nice to be able to make futa_on_male images -- that has always been *SUPER* tough, but somewhat possible with in-painting.  In the new model, it will produce a dog on a woman before it will make doggystyle futa on male, no matter how many times it is repeated or emphasized as a prompt.
