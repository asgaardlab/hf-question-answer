contains_question: yes

question_part: I think it's because when I push models they are labeled as Text to Audio, but you somehow got it working for this model.. It's clearly labeled as Text-to-Speech, so I wanted to ask is there anything you've done specially different with this model? Have you experienced the same? Do you have any advices for me?
