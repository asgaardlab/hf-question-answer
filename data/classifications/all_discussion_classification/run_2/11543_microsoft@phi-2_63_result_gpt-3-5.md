contains_question: yes

question_part: I was wondering what could be the reason, it it `max_new_token` parameter? Do we need to set it up explicitly for every query, after guessing what could be the length where Phi-2 won't add some redundant texts. Second question I have is regrading support of sampling of generated text.
