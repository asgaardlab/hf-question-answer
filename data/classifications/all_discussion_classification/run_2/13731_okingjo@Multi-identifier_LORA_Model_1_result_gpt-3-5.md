contains_question: yes

question_part: I am currently trying to train a character LoRA with two outfits, but the bleedthrough between both concepts is severeðŸ˜”. In your guide you say the tags should not be the same across concepts, however my character has both outfits in the same exact pose etc. Should I better delete these images for one outfit?
