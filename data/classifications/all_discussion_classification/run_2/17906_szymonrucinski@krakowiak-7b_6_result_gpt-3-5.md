contains_question: yes

question_part: Using a laptop with a 4GB GPU for inference - does it make at all sense to try?
Is there a chance to get any output in reasonable time? Let's say **15-20 minutes would be OK** for the experiments I am conducting.
I am wondering if there is anything I could improved in my setup **or** the only way to go is switching to a more powerful machine right away.
