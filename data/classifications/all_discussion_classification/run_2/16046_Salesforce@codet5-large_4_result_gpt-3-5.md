contains_question: yes

question_part: maybe a n00b question, how can I choose which code generation task to translate with this model?
In your paper you performed several code generation tasks (code-to-code, text-to-code etc.), I'm interested in code-to-code, but I'm not sure if this model performs the code-to-code task when I call `model(input_ids)` or other tasks.
