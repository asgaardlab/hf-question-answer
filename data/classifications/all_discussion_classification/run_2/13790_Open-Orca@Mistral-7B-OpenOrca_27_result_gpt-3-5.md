contains_question: yes
question_part: It would be very helpful if it could be provide some scenarios of code , specially with multi-round conversation and other samples of code. Is there a at least a general documentation for the Orca models?

I understand that uses standard openai chatML, but still, It would be greatly appreciated to have some usage guidance.
