contains_question: yes

question_part: Any suggestions on how to resolve this shape mismatch error so that I can properly load and run the StableBeluga2-GGML model with text-generation-webui would be greatly appreciated, or if there are any good resources for learning since I have been unsuccessful with any of the 70b models and donâ€™t know where it is going wrong. Thank you in advance for your help! :)
