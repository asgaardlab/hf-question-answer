contains_question: yes

question_part: About this model in specific, which version of Noromaid was used, 0.1.1 or 0.2? I assume it was 0.2 but the models name says "v0.1".
Also, if I must say and then ask, I had a very good experience with the Toppy-Mix-4x7B.Q4_K_M model, would you be able to maybe pump more 4x7B models in the near future? I say this because, 8x7B is borderline unusable for me (and for a lot of people, which has poor hardware, like me.) simply too big I am afraid.
