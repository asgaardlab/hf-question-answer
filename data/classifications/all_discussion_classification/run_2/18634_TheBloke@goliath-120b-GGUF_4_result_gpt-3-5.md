contains_question: yes

question_part: I've been unable to get models over about 70B parameters to run on Runpod using webchat-UI—not GGUF or GPTQ—no matter what I try. I'm using multiple processors so it shouldn't be a hardware problem. My guess is that I'm not understanding something basic like how to fetch models that have been segmented due to file size or configure setups with multiple processors.
