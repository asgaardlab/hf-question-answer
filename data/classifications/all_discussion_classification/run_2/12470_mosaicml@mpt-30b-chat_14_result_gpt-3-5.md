contains_question: yes

question_part: Compared with the model when it was first released (the version about 1 month ago), the performance of the new version of the model seems to have dropped a lot, especially in Chinese. I also found that the Chinese output does not seem to be generated token by token using TextIteratorStreamer, but paragraph by paragraph. Did something go wrong with the sampling? btw, is there any way to get the previous version of the model?
