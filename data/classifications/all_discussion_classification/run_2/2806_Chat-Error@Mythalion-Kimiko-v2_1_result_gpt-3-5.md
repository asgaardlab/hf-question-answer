contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Mythalion (enhanced MythoMax) with Kimiko AND a 8K context buffer? Why no discussion !?
nRuaif, is this what I think it is, what it appears to be?
I don't know why nobody has noticed or talked about this model until now? It's like you quietly slipped it out there with no fanfare or notice and nobody noticed it existed?
Did you spend much time playing with this model yourself? What are your own thoughts on it? How does it compare versus MythoMax Kimiko and Mythalion? Maybe you're just humble, but if I were in your shoes, I'd have wanted a lot more people to be aware this model existed.
