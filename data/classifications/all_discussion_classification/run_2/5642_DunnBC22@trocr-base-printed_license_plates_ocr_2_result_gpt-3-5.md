contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm trying to use it to read US license plates, but I'm not getting very good accuracy, and so I wonder if I'm missing a key step here. Am I missing any steps? Is this the wrong model to use for US plates? Should I be doing any kind of preprocessing on the image first?
