contains_question: yes
question_part: I am wondering if it would be possible to use your insilico perturbation analysis to extract the directionality of change of the affected genes. If I understood your work correctly, you illustrate, among other things, how to quantify the gene embeddings change (cosine distance) in response to the deletion / over expression  to illustrate the connectivity between the perturbed and affected gene. Would it be possible to use your model to understand the directionality of the perturbation  (e.g. what genes become up or down regulated upon the deletion of MECP2)  - and if so, would you have any pointers where one could start?
