contains_question: yes
question_part: Are Replit Ghostwriter and this replit-code-v1-3b the same model? If not, then what are the differences? Asking because I've heard of Replit Ghostwriter before, which is an AI that autocompletes your code, and I think the code model from here is also a model for code completion. Please forgive me if I asked something that is probably stupid, but I am just curious.
