contains_question: yes

question_part: The current default code generation response is too lengthy and multiple. Can I make it only complete the code once and no extra comments added? Also which programming language can it speak? mostly for Python. And it is the reason you named it Phi? Especially is it trained with SQL (MySQL and Oracle, SQLite etc, Spider benchmark dataset)?
