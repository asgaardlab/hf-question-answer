contains_question: yes

question_part: I had previously run a task on TheBloke_Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored-GPTQ. I had to modify it a good bit as this model tends to want to "elaborate on its input using its knowledge of the topic" when I wanted it to only act on what the input text said. And a couple other issues, like it tending to only focus on the end of the input text. But I was largely able to fix them via prompt adjustments. Now it's making nice, neatly-formatted, consistent responses, and overall the output is better than TheBloke_Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored-GPTQ. Very nice!
