question_part: Hello, when the prompts are post-fixed with "painting" the image generated has all 4 sides with black and/or white outlines. The model shows the image like it is a real painting with white, or black, or wooden outlines,  or it is shown drawn in paper in front of a wall like it is a real painting. That did happen a week ago but it was unusual , now almost every picture is drawn outlined. Has the model changed in some ways the last few days, or is it my faulty assumption that it didn't happen so regularly
