contains_question: yes

question_part: My confusion is, do I need to use the same format which is given in HF fine tuning tutorial to train this model on my data or do I need to pass the data in some different way in this model. Because the model showed in HF tutorial to fine tune a model is a classification model so it contains one text column and one label column. But in my case I have text column and its key phrase column for each row of text. Does that means that I need to feed my dataset with just two columns only, one with text and another one is with key phrase column instead of label column as showed in the HF tutorial for classification model. Please guide.
