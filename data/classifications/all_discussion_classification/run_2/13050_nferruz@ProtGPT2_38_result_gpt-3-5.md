contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. Could you share the accuracy and loss metrics during both the training and evaluation phases of ProtGPT2?
2. Following the guidelines provided on the [Hugging Face model page](https://huggingface.co/nferruz/ProtGPT2), I have fine-tuned the ProtGPT2 model for a specific task. To ensure the quality of the fine-tuning, could you recommend methodologies to effectively evaluate the fine-tuned model, focusing on assessing for 'catastrophic forgetting', ensuring it retains some of its prior knowledge?
