contains_question: yes
question_part: My guess would be that the assumptions about GPT4 being dumber over time are true, you said you were using the june version of gpt4 to create the 2.0 dataset, it seems like the march version of GPT4 gave better outputs and that's why the 1.4 dataset seems to be better in my book.
