contains_question: yes

question_part: apologies if this is a silly question, I am a bit new to this. I've started playing around with falcon-40b-instruct and I have noticed that regardless of what prompt I give it, it always returns the entire prompt as well as the output. This makes it pretty difficult to chain prompts together using langchain. Is this how the model is supposed to behave? If no then what do people think I'm doing wrong? If yes then what is the most appropriate way to handle this?
