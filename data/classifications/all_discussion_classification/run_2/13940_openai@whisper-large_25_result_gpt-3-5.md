contains_question: yes

question_part: My question is, how do I figure out what URL this downloads the model from? Is the model being downloaded from there or is it being downloaded from hugging face hub (because I also see a convert function to save a pytorch model object at a specific location)? This is needed so I can add this URL to an accept list, allowing my flask app to access and download from it.
