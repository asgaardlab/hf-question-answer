question_part: Why is this model significantly bigger than microsoft/deberta-v3-large
The original pytorch_model.bin under microsoft/deberta-v3-large is 874MB, but the pytorch_model.bin file here is 1.7GB. I'm wondering why this model is much bigger. Is this model saved in full precision? Very much appreciate your reply!
