contains_question: yes

question_part: My question is, I am applying a model SFT to chat data. But my question is, should we make this type of chat format SFT or should we apply DPO or RHLF directly? What's the problem with this? What path should we follow? Isn't SFT suitable? Do we need to do DPO or RHLF directly? Topics I really don't understand. Where am I doing wrong? What should be the difference? How can I continue without destroying the structure?
