question_part: How do I get sentence level timestamps?
Maybe I am overlooking something, but I am not seeing a way to get sentence level timestamps. With the openai whisper library, when you use "transcribe" you will get a timestamp for each text chunk (not word level, text chunk). I am not seeing an equivalent here. Can you please guide me?
