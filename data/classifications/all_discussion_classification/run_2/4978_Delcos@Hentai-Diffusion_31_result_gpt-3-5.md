contains_question: yes

question_part: Why are you lying (results are from novelai-pruned)
I don't get why you'd need to lie about your model results. You're showing off "incremental improvements" and getting some reddit karma on the results, and only if users "use the universal negative prompt" you could somehow make an infinite monika dreambooth/model  of your own.
