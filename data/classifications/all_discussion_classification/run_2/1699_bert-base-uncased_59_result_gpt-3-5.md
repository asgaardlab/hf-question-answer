contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Are the checkpoint here from Google and trained with Google's data (which they never shared)? Or do the checkpoints actually come from training on the Wikipedia and BookCorpus that is publicly available on HuggingFace ? In order words, will I be able to replicate this checkpoint by training on https://huggingface.co/datasets/wikipedia and https://huggingface.co/datasets/bookcorpus
