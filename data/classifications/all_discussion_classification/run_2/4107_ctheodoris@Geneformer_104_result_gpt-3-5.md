contains_question: yes

question_part: Is it possible to incorporate their information into your pretrained models by self-supervised training (no cell-type annotation)? After that, I can use dataset A to fine-tune for cell classification and finally infer the cell types in dataset B. Will this way improve the classification of dataset B?
