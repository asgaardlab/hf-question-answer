contains_question: yes

question_part: Hello, I recently use this model to do Chinese image OCR, but I got the wrong words output, the code I use is below:
The Image I use is from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/viking714/timuimage, everyone can see the image, it's public.
I use the same method to OCR English images to words by LayoutXLM and LayoutLMV2 models, they are both ok. 
Thank you very much.
