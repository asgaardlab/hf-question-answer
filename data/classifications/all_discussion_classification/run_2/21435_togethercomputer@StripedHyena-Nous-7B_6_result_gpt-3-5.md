contains_question: yes

question_part: I would like to know the finetuning code details of Striped Hyena Nous 7b.Unlike Transformers models it extends some architectural changes,so should the code for finetuning and training on custom dataset differs.Can i follow same approach to finetune like Zephyr7b?.Hoping for a reference code or additional clarity on this.
