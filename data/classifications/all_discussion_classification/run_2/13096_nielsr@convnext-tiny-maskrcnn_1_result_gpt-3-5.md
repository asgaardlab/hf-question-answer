contains_question: yes
question_part: Hello, wanted to add a cascade rcnn to a transfromer backbone. Is there any documentation for the same or maybe some resources that someone can point me to? I see a couple of models by  @nielsr that do include such models (for example : nielsr/convnext-tiny-maskrcnn) ... but I would like to experiment and train my own models with these additional blocks. Can someone help me out with this task?
