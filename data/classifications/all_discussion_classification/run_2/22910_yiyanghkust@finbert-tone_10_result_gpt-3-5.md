contains_question: yes

question_part: I am wondering why this is happening? It only occurs for some sentences. Moreover, the local transformer seems to select the highest probability result and return it alone compared to the API that returns a score for each label. Sometimes a score from the API is greater than 1 (have seen 9) and I am wondering why that is and am if the model is still functioning properly.
