contains_question: yes

question_part: So I've tried running this model in Ooba but I can't get it to load. I'm not sure what model loader to use. I can get an Airboros 13b model to run on my rig but I get errors with every option I try with this one. Unfortunately I don't understand what the errors are saying but I don't think it is a memory issue. Sorry for being new to all this.
