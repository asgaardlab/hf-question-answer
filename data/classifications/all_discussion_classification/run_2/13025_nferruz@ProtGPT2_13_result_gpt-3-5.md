question_part: I have two simple questions about generating sequences using ProtGPT2:
1. About the timing, by simply using the example case:
It takes 62 seconds for me in jupyter notebook with a GPU NVIDIA TITAN Xp. As you described, the generation should be very fast with a GPU. I am wondering if the codes above assign the GPU to do the generation.
2. As you described in other issue panels, the generation process will generate sequences with
