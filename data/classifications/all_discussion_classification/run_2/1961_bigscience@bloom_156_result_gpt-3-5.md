contains_question: yes
question_part: Suppose I were to build a machine that had enough ram for the model to be resident for the lifetime of the program, what kind of CPU would be necessary to hit performance in the ballpark of a token per second or better  Or is this use case only suitable for expensive cloud deployment and would I be better off exploring a lighter but less capable model (and if so, which one)
