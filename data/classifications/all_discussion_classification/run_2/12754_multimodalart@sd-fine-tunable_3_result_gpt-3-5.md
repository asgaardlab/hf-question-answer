contains_question: yes
question_part: 
So, what exactly is different between this model and the default model?
How does this impact Dreambooth training?
Does the config also impact the [ShirvamShrirao version](https://colab.research.google.com/github/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/blob/main/examples/dreambooth/DreamBooth_Stable_Diffusion.ipynb) or the [Joe Penna version](https://github.com/JoePenna/Dreambooth-Stable-Diffusion) of Dreambooth scripts out there?
Can I just copy affected config to my own models to achieve the same?
