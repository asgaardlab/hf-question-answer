contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. I found that many seemingly normal hands are still not being detected. I feel that this area could benefit from adding some bad hand training data to improve recognition rates.
2. When two hands overlap, one hand is often not detected, which causes the non-overlapping hand to become deformed after redrawing.
3. The redrawing area may appear incongruous on the original image, especially with complex backgrounds. It feels like feathering could be added to address this issue.
