contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. The region where the dog is removed is missing details and is blurred but also and other parts of the bench are blurred, making it looking "artificial". I don't know if this is the purpose  - to change the entire picture not only what is under the mask?. Usually inpaint is understood as filling in only the region under the mask?
