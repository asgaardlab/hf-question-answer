contains_question: yes

question_part: It mentions in the paper that you randomly selected sequences for the test dataset. Shouldn't we consider something like sequence similarity and also make sure there are no sequences in the test dataset that are also in the training dataset to prevent data leakage? Do you have code released for how you trained the model?
