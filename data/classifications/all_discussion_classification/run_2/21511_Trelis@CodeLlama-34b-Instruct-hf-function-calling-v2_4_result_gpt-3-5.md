contains_question: yes

question_part:
Is it possible to make a function definition like this? Its currently in the chatgpt format. I know its beefy, and I've been training my own adapters here and would be happy to create my own training data to see if I can expand the capabilities, but I'm just wondering if its currently possible to run nested arrays and objects like this already.
