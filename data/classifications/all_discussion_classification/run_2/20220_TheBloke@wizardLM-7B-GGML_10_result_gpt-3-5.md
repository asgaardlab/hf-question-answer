contains_question: yes

question_part: I am wondering if anyone else is crazy enough to pair the ggml and qlora together like myself and make it work. I think it is because it wants the float16 version because the qlora was trained on float16 or if it is just impossible. Anyone get it to work or am I glossing over something?
