contains_question: yes  
question_part: It only seems to happen once I have already made one canny or depth image with the new clora, then I cannot make any more I have to go to another workflow, reload the already "loaded" tensors, and then go back and load the model a third time for only a single new image to complete...  

Anyone know how to fix this on the windows portable install? I installed the nodes through Comfy Manager.  

Thanks!
