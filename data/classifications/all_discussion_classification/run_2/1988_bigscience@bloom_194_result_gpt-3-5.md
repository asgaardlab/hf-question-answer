contains_question: yes

question_part: I am having a hard time finding information on how to setup bloom on my local machine, does big science have any official documentation for setup/config. Stuff i've found online seems to be rather specific to cloud or virtual machine setups. If not does anyone have any good resources for setting up the 178b bloom model on a local machine. (bearing in mind I have four gtx 1080s in a rig to run it on).
