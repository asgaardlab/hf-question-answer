> solve this equation and explain each step 2Y-12=-16
To solve the equation 2Y - 12 = -16, we need to isolate the variable Y on one side of the equation. Here are the steps to do that:

Step 1: Subtract 12 from both sides of the equation to isolate the term 2Y:
2Y - 12 - 12 = -16 - 12
Simplifying this step, we get:
2Y = -4

Step 2: Divide both sides of the equation by 2 to isolate Y:
2Y/2 = (-4)/2
Simplifying this step, we get:
Y = -2

Therefore, the solution to the equation 2Y - 12 = -16 is Y = -2. This means that if we substitute -2 for Y in the original equation, we will get a true statement:
2(-2) - 12 = -16
-4 - 12 = -16
-16 = -16
This shows that the solution is valid because it satisfies the original equation.

> Mark is faster than Mary , Mary is faster than Joe. Is Joe faster than Mark?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Based on the given information, we can make a comparison chart:

|   | Mark | Mary | Joe  |
|---|------|------|------|
| Faster than | X    | Y    |
| Slower than | /    | \    |

From the chart, we can see that Mary is faster than Joe. However, we cannot determine whether Joe is faster than Mark or not since there is no information about their relative speeds.
