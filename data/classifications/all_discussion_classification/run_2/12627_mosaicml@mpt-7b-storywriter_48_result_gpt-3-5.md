contains_question: yes

question_part: Forgive my ignorance, but I have searched everywhere I can think of for an answer to this question... You require set_remote_code=True and provide the code to be used.   Where exactly do I put the code?  I have searched the configuration files and python files for a proper place, but I'm just too new to understand what to do.  I'm using ooba and my system is a 5800x Ryzen, 3070 8 mb, with 32 gb ram.  Thank you!
