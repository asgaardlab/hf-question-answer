contains_question: yes

question_part: I would like to ask whether there is some difference between the models converted by Guernika Model Converter/script provided in this repository and the procedure described in Mochi Diffusion repository... Also, I'd like to ask whether there are plans to support HD upscaling... Lastly, do you have any data on how much memory is needed for an iOS device to run stable diffusion with Unet chunked VS non chunked
