contains_question: yes

question_part: As such, I'm trying to find out how efficient it is to train using REINFORCE by using the probability of output generation: P(decoder_output). Is there a way to obtain the output generation logits for greedy decoding, something like... However, I think this might output incorrect probabilities owing to the teacher forcing. Is that correct?
