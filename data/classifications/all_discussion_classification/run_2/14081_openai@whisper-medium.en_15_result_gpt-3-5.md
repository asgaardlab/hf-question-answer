contains_question: yes

question_part: As suggested in the model card for distil-whisper/distil-medium.en, I am using flash attention 2 to get the best results. I don't completely understand the concept behind flash attention 2. Do I need to use it with openai/whisper-medium.en for a fair comparison? If yes, 1) Is it feasible to use flash attention 2 with openai/whisper-medium.en? 2) How?
