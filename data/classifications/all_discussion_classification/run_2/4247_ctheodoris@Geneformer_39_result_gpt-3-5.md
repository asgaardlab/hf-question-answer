contains_question: yes
question_part: When I tried running the example in silico perturbation with the code below, I found that I could only use forward_batch_size=80, instead of 400, with a 24Gb-ram graphic drive. Is the batch size too small for the inference? If it is the case, could you recommend a better ram size for the purpose in general?
