contains_question: yes

question_part: Since I'm novice in transfer learning and I noticed that you exclude malignant in your training set. Does this means it might be not a good idea to classifying breast cancer cells using the fine-tuned, pre-trained model? Or, if it is possible to classify breast cancer cells, what strategy should I use? should I collect marked breast cancer cells' scRNA-seq public dataset, use the tokenizer, and fine-tune the pre-trained model?
