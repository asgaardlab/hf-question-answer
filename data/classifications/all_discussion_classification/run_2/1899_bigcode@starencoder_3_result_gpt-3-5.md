contains_question: yes

question_part: Since this is a BERT-style model, shouldn't there be a CLS token that I can use to get the embeddings of a snippet of code I input the model?
If I am misunderstanding something, is there a different way to get a "sentence level" embedding of code (e.g., python code) using this model?
