contains_question: yes

question_part: When you mention "Steps: 251000", are those pure steps without considering the batch size and grad accumulation? Or have they already been divided by the batch size/grad steps, like around 1960 steps? Also, it'd probably be helpful if you could also provide the number of epochs.
