contains_question: yes
question_part: Great work with Seine! It would be even better if this model repository could have a model card (it's essentially a README.md file in your repository that gets rendered like below, see an example [here](https://huggingface.co/damo-vilab/text-to-video-ms-1.7b/blob/main/README.md) for a `text-to-video` model). You can also demo the model in Spaces using gradio. Let me know if you want to add a demo and a model card and need help ðŸ¤—
