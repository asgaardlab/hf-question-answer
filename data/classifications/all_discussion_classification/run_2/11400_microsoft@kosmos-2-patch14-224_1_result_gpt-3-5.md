contains_question: yes
question_part: I am trying to run the example in README. However, I got  `KeyError: 'kosmos-2'` after running `model = AutoModelForVision2Seq.from_pretrained("microsoft/kosmos-2-patch14-224")`. The version of my `transformers ` is `4.33.3`.  Is this an issue of the version? If so, which version should I install? Also, could you provide an input example with interleaved text and multiple images? I am confused how to construct the input for an input sequence with text and multiple images.
