contains_question: yes

question_part: The chat_template specified in tokenizer_config.json is ChatML, but apparently this model uses the (weird) GPT4 Correct prompt format. Please clarify which is the correct prompt format/chat template and kindly state it on the model card, and make sure tokenizer_config.json also has the proper template.
