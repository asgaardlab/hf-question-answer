contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. Could you specify which Korean vocabulary or tokenizer you are utilizing? I am under the impression that the foundational vocabulary might be `llama-2`. Is the new 'one' derived from the `polyglot-ko` vocabulary or something else?
2. Could you elaborate on the process of merging two tokenizers while keeping the original one?
