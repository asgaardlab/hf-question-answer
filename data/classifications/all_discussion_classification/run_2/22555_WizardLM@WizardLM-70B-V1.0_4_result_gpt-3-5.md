contains_question: yes

question_part: Please release the dataset used to train this model.
Would love for this to be a truly open-source model, as it used to be.
It's very sad and unfortunate that @WizardLM hasn't released the data for 1.1 or 1.2 or WizardCoder.
Similar to when OpenAI decided to become closed.
Please change your mind and start releasing your datasets as well as your models.
The community will greatly appreciate this.  We love our open-source community and very sad to lose WizardLM to closed-source.
