contains_question: yes

question_part: I have tried to run the original stable diffusion code with this weight, but the `txt2img.py` need to specify `--config` otherwise it will throw an error. I tried `sd_finetune_256.yaml` in the repository but the result was a mess.  Is there anyone know how to set the `--config` parameters?
