contains_question: yes
question_part: I am new here and I am really lost in trying to use this model in Visual Studio. Does any of you have any idea on how I can use it? I have tried the 'use in PEFT' lines of code but it exceeds my machine capabilities? Is there any possibility to use only one pytorch model from all the ones present in this directory ?
