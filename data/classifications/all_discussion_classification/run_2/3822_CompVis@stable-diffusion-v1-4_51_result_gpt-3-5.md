contains_question: yes

question_part: I've been struggling to figure out how to actually utilise all this hard work for several hours now. I thought myself quite good at following instructions, but I'm having a difficult time discerning if there even are any instructions. I've cloned sd-v1-4.ckpt, but I've no idea what I'm supposed to do with it,  I've connected my HF hub token and I've ran the example python code and received nothing but errors.
