contains_question: yes
question_part: Not sure what I am doing wrong. Can someone help me understand why my accuracy is not reaching 91.3%
Also, at the same webpage, on the right side, it says the accuracy with glue is 91.1% and the accuracy with sst2 is 98.9%, which I am not sure what it means (I thought sst2 was part of the glue dataset). What are these numbers and why are they still different than 91.3%?
