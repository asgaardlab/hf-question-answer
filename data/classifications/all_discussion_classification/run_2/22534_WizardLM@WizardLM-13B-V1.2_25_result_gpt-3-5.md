contains_question: yes

question_part: For example, when I asked Meta's full 70B "aligned" version of Llama 2 about the Meghan Trainor song "Dear Future Husband" using the lyric "And don't forget the flowers every anniversary" it said the song didn't exist, then lectured me about spreading misinformation online. Then I referred to the song by name in my follow up question "Dear Future Husband". Llama 2 refused to answer and lectured me about using potentially hurtful gender stereotypes. I then tricked it into answering my question. Proving it was aware of the lyric and the song.
