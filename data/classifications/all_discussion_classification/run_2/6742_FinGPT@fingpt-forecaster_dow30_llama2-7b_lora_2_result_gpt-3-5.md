contains_question: yes
question_part: What are the tasks for this model? It would be great to have an example. It seems the ticket, Date, n_weeks, and Use Latest Basic Financials would be the inputs with values. https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT/blob/master/fingpt/FinGPT_Forecaster/README.md has the following inputs, but not sure how to use that to pass into the query to get output that has the "Information" and "Response" seen in the HuggingFace UI. Thanks.
