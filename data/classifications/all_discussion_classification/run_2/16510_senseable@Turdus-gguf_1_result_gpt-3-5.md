contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I found this model on the leaderboard and I was waiting for someone to publish it in gguf format but it took a long time, how can I do it myself ? does it require a high end pc ?

also can you please upload [Q5_K_S.gguf] Or [Q4_K_M.gguf] because I have only 8gb ram (:
