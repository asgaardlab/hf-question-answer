contains_question: yes

question_part: Anime V3 is degrading?

It seems, anime V3 has a lot more struggles creating specific characters from game/anime.

For example Ganyu.

While V2 can generate a decent image from just a name of the character, in V3 you'd need something like "A character named Ganyu from Genshin Impact", and it still struggles a lot more than V2, somehow.
