contains_question: yes
question_part: I was wondering about your take concerning the way to deal with an expansion of the vocabulary at no cost, especially the V_{distinct} set (referring to the $4 of the introducing paper). Indeed, CTI possess these specifics that other specialized fields do not: the expanding - or even moving (like an average) - actual vocabulary due to the evolution of the threat landscape at the tactical level : new (dubbed) malware, threat actors, campaigns, tools, intrusion sets, etc. 
The contextual nature of BERT could of course render objective embeddings, but even the possibility to generate those embeddings is conditionned to a suitable "basis" in the vocabulary.
