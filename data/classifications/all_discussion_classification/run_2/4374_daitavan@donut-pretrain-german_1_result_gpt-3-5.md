contains_question: yes  
question_part: Hi, maybe this is a newbie question, but what was this model trained/whatâ€™s the state of the training? As i read from the paper of the original donut model, the base model was trained with synthdog documents. i assume you did the same with the dataset on your account? is the training of this model completed?
