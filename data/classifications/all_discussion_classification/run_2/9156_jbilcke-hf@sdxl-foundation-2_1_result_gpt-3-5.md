contains_question: yes

question_part: I was looking at this and some of your other uploads, well the ones that are xl archives. I don't see a safetensor file in the root directory, that matches the name of the archive, like  sdxl-foundation-2.safetensors or something. I see a bunch of your training folder data, like 2000 and 3000. Is the lora the 23 mb pytorch in the 3000 folder? Should I just take that safetensor and rename it? I was wondering if you could explain how/which file  to get from these archives.
