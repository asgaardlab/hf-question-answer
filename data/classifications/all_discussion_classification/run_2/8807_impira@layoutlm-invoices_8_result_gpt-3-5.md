contains_question: yes

question_part: There are pdf's where the detected field is correct but not what i want {for eg: asking for date returns the delivery date mentioned in the invoice instead of the invoice date}. Is it possible to configure the model in a way for it to output the top n number of found items with their scores instead of just one.
