contains_question: yes

question_part: Are you planning to eventually release this under a permissive license (ie Apache 2.0 - that is the license of Tortoise, which this is based on)? I read the article about the CPML license, but I was wondering if it might be possible to use this for commercial purposes eventually. Thanks!
