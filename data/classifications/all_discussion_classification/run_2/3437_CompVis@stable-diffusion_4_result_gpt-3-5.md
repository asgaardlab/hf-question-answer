contains_question: yes
question_part: I sent the academic use request a week ago without getting any feedback, so I wonder if there is an estimated time for replying to the request. I am also not sure how much detail we should provide in the Nature of Research section. Currently, my reply is quite general (that is, I am working on understanding and mitigating the biases in text-to-image synthesis), which I guess should not be the reason for not getting feedback.
