contains_question: yes

question_part: The issue is that when I put a full article as input for example an article with 1500 words and I want the AI model to edit it or rewrite it somehow, the output will become so much smaller than the input for example the output will be 900 words and it seems that the AI model forgets some parts of the input. I would like to ask you to help me regarding this issue and tell me how can I put a full article as input and expect a model to rewrite it for me as I want without losing any details of it and without making it much smaller.
