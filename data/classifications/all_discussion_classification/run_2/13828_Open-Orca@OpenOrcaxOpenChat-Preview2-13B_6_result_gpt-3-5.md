contains_question: yes

question_part: Can you explain how can we train multi-turn conversation?
I am quite surprised that it's pretty good for chat. Very few models have this capability.
Can you provide more information about training multi-turn conversation since datasets just contain a pair of question-answer information; I am curious how we can fine-tune it for conversational purposes.
