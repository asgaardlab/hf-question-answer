contains_question: yes

question_part: 
Could you tell me the specific dataset that you used for the finetuning? For my part, I'm using a French-translated version of the SamSum dataset. Nevertheless, I'm curious as to whether you've made use of a different dataset?

Also, did you initiate your training with the basic mBarthez model, or did you instead start with a version of mBarthez that had already been trained on the OrangeSum Abstract dataset?
