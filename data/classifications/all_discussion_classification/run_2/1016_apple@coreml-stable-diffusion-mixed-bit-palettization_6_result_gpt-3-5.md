contains_question: yes

question_part: Thanks for the work on the model.
On both this repo and the `coreml-stable-diffusion-xl-base`there are wrong / no instructions for how to load and use the model with `diffusers`. 

In fact, the `coreml-stable-difusion-xl-base` README currently says to use `cuda`, which certainly won't work.

Any chance we can add an example Python script that works for either / both?
