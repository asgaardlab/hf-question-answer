question_part:
fp16 branch?
hi @lllyasviel, would it be acceptable to create a fp16 branch on this repo?
Also, is there a need for uploading differenced models? Would it be easier for those writing their projects to use these.?
Lastly, is there negative effects when patching fp16 with certain models, where it is preferable to have the full weights to avoid NaNs error?
