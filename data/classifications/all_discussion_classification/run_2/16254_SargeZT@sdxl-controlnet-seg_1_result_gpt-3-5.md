contains_question: yes
question_part: I am trying to use Controlnet.forward() using this model weights. However, I am encountering problem with inputting key and values for added_cond_kwargs, specifically "time_ids" and "text_embeds". Great if you can show me an example of doing one forward pass using your model weights.
