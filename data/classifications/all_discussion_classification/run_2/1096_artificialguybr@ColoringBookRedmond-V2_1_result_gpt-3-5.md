contains_question: yes

question_part: Your LORAs are really good! For several days I'm trying to make a silhouette Lora for my project and failed miserably after testing many approaches. I've made a 170 images dataset, several types of descriptions etc, made a quite a few training's but results not good. I would be so appreciated if you can share your Lora training config (I'm using Kohya SS and SDXL 1.0) and several images/prompts pairs so I understand how it build. Any other tips and tricks will be much appreciated. Thank you very much in advance!
