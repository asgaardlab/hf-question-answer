contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm currently conducting some NLP research and i'm trying to understand the difference between RoBERTa (https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/roberta) and RoBERTa-base (https://huggingface.co/roberta-base). I've read several pages online but it's still not very clear. It seems as though RoBERTa-base is just a RoBERTa model with default configuration? Could someone advise please?
