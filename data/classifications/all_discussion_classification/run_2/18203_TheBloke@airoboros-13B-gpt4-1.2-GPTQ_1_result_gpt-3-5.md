contains_question: yes

question_part: I feel a bit ashamed having to seek some assistance because I've used tons of your models in the past without issues but today's 1.2 version models seem to only output gibberish for me. at first, I thought I was using the wrong instruct template but it doesn't seem to matter what I choose it always comes out broken. is there a setting or file I missed somewhere?
