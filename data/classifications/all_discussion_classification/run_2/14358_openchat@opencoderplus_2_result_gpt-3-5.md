question_part: How did this model come to be?
I dont quite get what this model is about. Is it just a 8-bit version of starcoderplus? Did you train it more? Its clearly smaller in terms of file size by about half so at the very least its quantized but your readme doesnt really explain the main difference between this and the original starcoderplus. I think you should update it and add some more information
