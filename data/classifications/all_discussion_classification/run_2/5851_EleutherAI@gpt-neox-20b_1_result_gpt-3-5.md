contains_question: yes

question_part: I cannot seem to locally load the model in colab using the git function. It shows that setup.py is missing. Also, when I try to use the normal method of "from transformer import", I am not able to load it cause the RAM gets over. I am using Google Colab pro account. Is there a way for me to resolve this?
