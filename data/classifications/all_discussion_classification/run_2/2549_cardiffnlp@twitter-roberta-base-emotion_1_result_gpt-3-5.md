contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I tried the inference API with a lot of basic inputs which  were abusive/angry but the model output is always "joy".  Is there perhaps a bug somewhere in inference code? With this data set "I hate you" shouldn't be getting classified as "joy" in my opinion.
