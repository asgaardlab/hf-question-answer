contains_question: yes

question_part: Is it normal that I'm getting really poor responses from the SuperHOT models I tested? E.g. they stop in the middle of the sentence (Wizard-Vicuna 13B 8K) or add some strange formating like ```makefile (Wicuna 1.3 13B 8K) etc. Maybe I'm missing something? I use ooba + AutoGPTQ, nothing fancy.
