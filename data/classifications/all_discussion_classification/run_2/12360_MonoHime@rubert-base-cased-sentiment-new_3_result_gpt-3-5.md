contains_question: yes
question_part: When adding a simple negation for the default example ("Ты мне **не** нравишься. Я тебя **не** люблю"), the model still labels it with high confidence as being positive. Any idea what may cause this? Maybe the model hasn't been trained sufficiently long on the dataset?
