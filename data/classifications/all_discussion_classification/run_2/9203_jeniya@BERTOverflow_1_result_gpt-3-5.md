contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I wanted to make sure this is the pre-trained checkpoint mentioned in this [repository](https://github.com/jeniyat/StackOverflowNER/tree/master/code) and how does it differ from this [checkpoint](https://huggingface.co/jeniya/BERTOverflow_stackoverflow_github). Do you also happen to have the fine-tuned checkpoints of the SoftNER model in the paper?
