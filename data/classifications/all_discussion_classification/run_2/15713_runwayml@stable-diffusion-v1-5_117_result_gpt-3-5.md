question_part: Am trying to change a photo I took which I uploaded into Stable Deffusion. ie trying to create an older version of the photo I took of the town's main to say  a realistic photo from say 50 years ago  Every time upload the photo and  put in the prompt it generates a completely new image rather than editing the image I uploaded.
