contains_question: yes

question_part: I was wondering on what type of data the model was trained, the model seems to have a different dictionary from the Naver Clova one (which has lots of Chinese characters).
I was also wondering what you believe should be changed to include a Token Classification head as for example the LayoutLM family.
