contains_question: yes

question_part: Human Eval and Human Eval-X score? , Using the Mistral 7B as base(HumanEval = 30ish), I wonder the 80K evol instruct would bring it above HumanEval=40. , Why not try Evo-Instruct on either Phi-1(already at HumanEval 50.6  or TinyLlama 1.1 to see if you can get Human Eval to > 60
