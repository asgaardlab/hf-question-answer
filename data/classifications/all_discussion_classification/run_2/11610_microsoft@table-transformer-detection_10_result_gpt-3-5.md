contains_question: yes  
question_part: Just a week back it was running all fine step by step on Google Colab notebook. However, I encountered the error while executing this line two days back: from transformers import TableTransformerForObjectDetection Please let me know what is wrong here. Has the main code changed or is it an issue because I am using a Google Colab notebook, CPU resource.
