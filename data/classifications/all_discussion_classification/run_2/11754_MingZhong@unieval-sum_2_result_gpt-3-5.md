contains_question: yes

question_part: If I don't have a ref_list when doing 'Summarization' tasks, only a model output_list, is that setting the ref_list as an empty list? I want to evaluate the model summaries, but it's expensive for us to have reference summary. Replacing the ref_list for empty list is reasonable
