How should ` Shift_to_goal_end` be interpreted?
What does a negative "Shift_to_goal_end" mean? for Gene A, I have a significant P-value, and negative Shift_to_goal_end.
What does a positive "Shift_to_goal_end" mean? for Gene B, I have a significant P-value, and positive Shift_to_goal_end.
what does a "Shift_to_goal_end" value close to 0 mean? or Gene C, I have a significant P-value, and 0 Shift_to_goal_end.
Should i just think of this as "closer to 1, closer to goal state. closer to -1, closer to start state"?
