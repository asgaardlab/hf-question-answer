contains_question: yes

question_part: 1. **Data Interpretation:** The paper mentions the use of 3202 high-coverage human genomes, totaling 20.5 trillion nucleotides. From my understanding, considering that each human genome is about 3.2 billion nucleotides, and accounting for diploid genomes, the calculation, 3.2B * 2 * 3202 =  20,492.8B = 20.5T, seems to match up with your figures. Can anyone confirm if this interpretation is correct or if there's something I'm missing?
