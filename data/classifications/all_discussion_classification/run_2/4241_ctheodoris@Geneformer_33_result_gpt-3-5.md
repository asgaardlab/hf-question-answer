contains_question: yes

question_part: However, I have a question. If I want to analyze brain tissue single-cell data using the "Chromatin dynamics predictions" and "Network dynamics predictions" tasks, do I need to re-fine-tune the Geneformer model using brain-specific information (such as look for brain central vs. peripheral genes within the N1 network), or can I directly apply your well-tuned model?
