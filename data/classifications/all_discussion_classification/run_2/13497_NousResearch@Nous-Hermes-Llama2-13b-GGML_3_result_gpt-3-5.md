contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm starting to feel like I'm the only one having this issue and it feels a bit ridiculous, because even though I normally use all kinds of different 13B GGML models, I just can't get this one to work for some reason. Is there anything I could do to fix the problem, please? Any help would be appreciated, thanks!
