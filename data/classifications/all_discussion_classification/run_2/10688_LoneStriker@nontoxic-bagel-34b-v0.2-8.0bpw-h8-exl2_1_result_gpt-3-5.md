contains_question: yes

question_part: I would love to run this model in 8bit, and I don't need more than 16k 'real' context.
but exllamav2 says not enough memory (2x4090 = 48GB).
Is there a mod I can make to config.json, or to exllamav2 config, that would allow me to load this?
6 bit, or even 6.5, seems to have lots of vram left over, so not sure why 8 bit won't load.
Any ideas? Tnx!
