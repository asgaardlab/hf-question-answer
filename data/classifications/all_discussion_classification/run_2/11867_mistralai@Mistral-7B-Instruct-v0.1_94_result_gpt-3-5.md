contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm curious to know if it's possible to apply the same setting when training the Mistral-7B-v0.1 model.
Is there any specific reason why `sliding_window` is set to `null` in the newer version, and what would be the implications if we apply the same setting to the older version?
