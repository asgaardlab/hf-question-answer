contains_question: yes

question_part: However, it's prose despite being improved are pretty GPT-ish, down to the 'ministrations' and 'connections'. And those common GPT phrases drive some folks, myself included a bit mad. That is to say, there's definitely room to improve the prose, despite this being, for now, the best solar instruct there is for RP. Specifically not just the GPTisms, but could use more descriptive and verbose language -obviously in the non-poetic way, but more punchy and compelling adjective use to describe actions and the scene. When punchy unexpected adjectives and descriptions start flying it gives the writing an edge - that's missing here.
