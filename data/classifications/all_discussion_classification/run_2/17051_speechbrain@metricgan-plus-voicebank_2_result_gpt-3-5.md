contains_question: yes

question_part: I observe that discriminator loss decreases rapidly and then oscilates around 0.05 or so, but generator loss oscilates much more without any observable trend to decrease. And other metrics (SI-SNR, pesq, stoi) oscilate accordingly.
Is this expected behaviour for first 50 epochs?
Is generator loss starts to decrease more noticeable on later epochs?
Do you have your training logs to compare with?
