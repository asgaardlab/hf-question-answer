contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. What is your training configuration? Such as, GPU numers, learning rate, fine tune strategy and epoch numbers.
2. Does your fine-tuning process overfit? When i start the second epoch, the training loss dropped significantly. Is this normal? Do you have any suggestions to avoid this problem?
