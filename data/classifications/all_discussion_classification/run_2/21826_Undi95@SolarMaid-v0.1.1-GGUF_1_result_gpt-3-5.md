contains_question: yes

question_part: Also I wonder if you could hybridize it with toppy, without increasing the size? Like maybe 32 of the bottom layers of solar instruct, and 16 of the topmost layers of Toppy? It might work because it has mistral layers mixed in there? Or noromaid as I guess solar is llama-2 and thus incompatible.
