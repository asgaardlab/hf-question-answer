contains_question: yes
question_part: 
- can you make specific models for man, I mean in anime models it is very difficult to generate male characters, male nsfw, kids, etc, so I wonder if you could make a specific model for male characters
- a model related to tentacles
- demon girls, or succubus, as you call them
- elemental girls, that is, girls of ice, fire, etc.
- Finally, futanari? I don't want to seem sick but models are also needed about this

Also, how do you make the models? what program do you use? dreambooth?, I would like to make models like yours
sorry if i'm asking too much, i try not to be annoying.
