contains_question: yes

question_part: is it possible to determine when quantizing, which bpw will be suitable for a given vram amount? I was thinking if you could state the figures in the model card. For example 3.0 bpw fits in 8gb of vram,4.0 bpw fits in 12gb vram,5.0 bpw fits in 16gb of vram and so on
