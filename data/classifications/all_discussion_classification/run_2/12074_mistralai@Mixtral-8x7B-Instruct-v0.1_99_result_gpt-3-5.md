contains_question: yes
question_part: My question is, I am applying a model SFT to chat data. I do this with the LLama-7b&13b-Chat-hf and Mistral-Instruction_V_2.0 models. But my question is, should we make this type of chat format SFT or should we apply DPO or RHLF directly? What's the problem with this? What path should we follow? Isn't SFT suitable? Do we need to do DPO or RHLF directly? Topics I really don't understand. Where am I doing wrong? Also; I am doing these operations by going over ready-made coding such as SFTrainer and DeepSpeedChat, but what should be the difference? How can I continue without destroying the structure?
