contains_question: yes

question_part: As best I can tell, there are two formats for models - CKPT and then "directory with model_info.json" - and diffusers only supports loading the latter using `from_pretrained` - is there anything I'm missing or straightforward script that could be added to the documentation that shows how to use this model with the diffusers package?
