question_part: How to save images from each denoising step?
Is it possible to save the intermediate images from each denoising step?  I'd like to see how the images evolve with every step.
I didn't see anything that might do the job, from looking through the parameter list of LDMTextToImagePipeline, or the output data structure.  Any help would be appreciated!
