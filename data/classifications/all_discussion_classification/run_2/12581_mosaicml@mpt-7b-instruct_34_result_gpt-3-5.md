contains_question: yes

question_part: 
i'm looking for some guidance on few shot prompting  with the mpt-7b models. is there any specific prompt format your team has found works well? Some other models (jurassic 2, etc) do well with few shot prompts with each example separated by a special separator token, is there any similar separator token here?
Additionally, what do you recommend as far as using the base model or instruction tuned model for few shot prompting?
