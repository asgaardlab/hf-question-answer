contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm wondering if `CUDA extension not installed` affects model performance. I can't figure out if it uses my GPU. It seems that I see a load on 6gb vram, but I donâ€™t see PID of the task that would work during inference. Maybe it works on the CPU? At times, inference can take a very long time.
