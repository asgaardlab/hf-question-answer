contains_question: yes

question_part: - Should I use the [recommended settings by localfultonextractor](https://files.catbox.moe/ue0tja.json) in v2's description for v3?
- I'm using SillyTavern v1.10.4 with the default Advanced Formatting settings ("Default" context template, instruct mode disabled), do you think using [these settings]() instead would improve Athena's conversation quality? I'll try them out and see for myself, but I'd love to have your opinions too :)
- Is there a Discord I can join to follow your development and feedback from other users
