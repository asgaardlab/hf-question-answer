contains_question: yes
question_part: It seems that Oobabooga can't read .pt files, but the description of the model states that it can be used with Oobabooga. The server launcher itself refuses to parse .pt files as model files and instead searches for .bin files, I believe. I'm not sure if I'm doing something wrong or the description should be updated to omit references to Oobabooga or if there's supposed to be a .bin file in the files somewhere.
