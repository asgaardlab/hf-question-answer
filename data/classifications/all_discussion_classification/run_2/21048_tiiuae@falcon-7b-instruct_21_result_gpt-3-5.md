contains_question: yes

question_part: 
1. Any idea how to resolve this? Should I just not run this stuff in a jupyter notebook?
2. I'm also not quite understand  `execute the configuration file in that repo on your local machine`. 
3. Is there any other better ways to avoid re-downaloding the model?
