contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, how did you merge the limarp with NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b? Hermes contains the added_tokens.json which makes it incompatible with some inference scripts. But your merge doesn't have this file and it works where the base model gives an error. It would be really great if you can share the method.
