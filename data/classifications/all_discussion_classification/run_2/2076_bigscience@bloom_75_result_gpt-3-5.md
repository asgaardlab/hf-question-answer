Hi all,
I have a question regarding the architecture. In the HF documentation, it is mentioned that Bloom is similar to GPT-3 but the model card indicates that the architecture is derived from Megatron-GPT2.
What is the best way to describe Bloom's architecture? GPT-2 or GPT-3 like?
I am a little bit lost here when I need to choose the best ancestor for Bloom :-)
