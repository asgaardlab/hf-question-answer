contains_question: yes

question_part: Since you ran the converter command on `2023-06-06`, I checked the original model [commit history ](https://huggingface.co/OpenAssistant/falcon-7b-sft-top1-696/commits/main) and there hasn't been new commits since `2023-06-06`. Can anyone reproduce this or have any insights as to what causes it? Thanks in advance.
