contains_question: yes

question_part: Did anyone managed to convert it to ggml for llama.cpp? I'm having a hard time converting it. Tried to convert this model and gptq model and both attempt ended up with error messages, and workarounds I searched on llama.cpp repository didn't work. Probably because I'm doing something stupid, since I've never done model converting before... It would be great if someone could share the ggml model.
