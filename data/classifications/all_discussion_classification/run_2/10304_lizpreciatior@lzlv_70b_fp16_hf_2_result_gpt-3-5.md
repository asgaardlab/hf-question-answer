contains_question: yes

question_part: I can't figure out how to make the model be descriptive like Emerthyst-20B (that model instead has problems with acting as the MC, which this model does not have). It defaults to small chat-like responses you would expect from smaller models even though I tell it to use long-form paragraphs. For a 70B model that's not great, and it has some problems sometimes with logical coherency for advanced RP prompts.
