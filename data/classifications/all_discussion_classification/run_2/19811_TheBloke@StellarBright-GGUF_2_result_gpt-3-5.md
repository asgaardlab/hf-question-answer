contains_question: yes
question_part: Any reason you don't have 70b in the name like most models have? Just makes it harder to track and list models if they don't declare their size. For example, I often enter "13b" or "70b" into the model filter on your model list to see what's there and what I might want to try at those sizes, which would mean this model wouldn't even show up. (and HF doesn't seem to filter on tags in that search box)
