contains_question: yes

question_part: Does anyone have any practical tips on speeding up MusicGen inference? I'm currently using a machine with a NVIDIA A10G Tensor Core GPU. Generation times for a 30 second clip take up to half an hour. Any recommendations on improvements? I'd love to get the times to sub 5 minutes if possible.
