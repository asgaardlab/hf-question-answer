contains_question: yes

question_part: Unfortunately, I seem to be hitting a wall trying to install the AI. What am I supposed to do about it? Wondering if the install itself is messed up somehow, so maybe I'll have to download and install everything from scratch again? My GPU trying to run it is a 10GB RTX 3080 (desktop) if that matters - I know it should ideally be 16+GB, but apparently people with even less powerful cards than mine are having some success? Any help or tips is welcome, and thank you in advance.
