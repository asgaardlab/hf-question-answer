contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm struggling to understand how I can easily use an inference class to transcribe enhanced audio files with the model. Clearly based on the 'test_stats' a model is produced that can perform ASR, but what interface to use for inference is a bit unclear - whether this needs to be something custom, or if it's simpler than that.
