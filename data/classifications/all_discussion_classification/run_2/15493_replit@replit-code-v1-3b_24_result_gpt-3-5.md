contains_question: yes

question_part: Some code model (like starcoder) can fill in the middle code by using some special tokens such as <fim_prefix>, <fim_middle>, <fim_suffix>... I have not seen this feature in the model's README file, so I want to know whether replit-code has feature like this or not.
