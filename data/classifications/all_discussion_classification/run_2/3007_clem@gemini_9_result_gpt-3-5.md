contains_question: yes

question_part: Not 100% if this is a fair comparison. Also it seems strange that they only report BLEURT scores as opposed to BLEU or chrF++ scores. Also can somebody with more experience using BLEURT say something about how meaningful the difference in performance of 74.4 (Gemini Ultra, all languages) vs 73.8 (GPT-4, all languages) is?
