contains_question: yes

question_part: The legal situation about this model is unclear to me. The model card says this was trained on LAION-2B-en. Is the organization (which manages huggingface.com/laion) implying that this model is a derivative work of that dataset? Either way, could the dataset card be updated with an explicit statement about this?
