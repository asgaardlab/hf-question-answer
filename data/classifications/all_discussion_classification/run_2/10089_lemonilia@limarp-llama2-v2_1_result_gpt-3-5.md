contains_question: yes

question_part: I hope you don't mind me asking a question. I am trying to use this adapter in koboldcpp and not really sure what I need to do there. I have been unable to get oogabooga to install at all, the start.bat install script doesn't do anything. Should I try and merge the adapter instead? What advice could you offer me on trying to use this adapter on some 7b models?
