contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi - curious what this model has been created for; can you provide a description? Also, I've been contributing to a repo that has Rust bindings for GGML files, and there seem to be some oddities in the way you've formatted this file - the file type in the hyperparameters is f32, and the vocabulary scoring doesn't seem to line up with the GGML/GGMF/GGJT format. Is this intentional? Do you have any plans to replace this file with one that is formatted correctly?
