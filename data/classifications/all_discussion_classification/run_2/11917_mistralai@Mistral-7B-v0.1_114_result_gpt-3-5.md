question_part: I know you usually do not put these type of stuff on the community tab of the projects, but let's be honest!

If you want to know more about what we've done, first you can find information [here](https://haghiri75.com/en/maral-is-here-7-billion-parameters-bilingual-model-with-support-of-persian/) and second, you can ask me anything here or in the community tab of our own project.
