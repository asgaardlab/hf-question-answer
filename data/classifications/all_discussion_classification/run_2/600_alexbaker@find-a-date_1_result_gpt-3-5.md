contains_question: yes  
question_part: One of the first things to start a conversation on a dating site is what kind of person they are looking for, whether it is someone who shares their interests and values or someone who is at the same stage of life as they are.
  
-Ask questions like what they do for a living, what their favorite movie or band is, or where they grew up. This will give the impression that you are interested in getting to know them as an individual and not just for their looks.  

- Don't be rude and don't judge them for their interests or the things they say.
