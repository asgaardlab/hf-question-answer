contains_question: yes

question_part: Especially, it's MUCH better than 2.1 and 2.2.1 at just stopping (I'm doing a lot of zero-shot prompts, so there aren't too many examples). In my tests 2.2.1 gives me good answers too but then keeps on completing what it shouldn't like from the examples or instructions. Sometimes 2.2 prints an errant codeblock at the end or adds an extra sentence, but the problems are so minimal compared to the disasters the same exact conditions evoke from 2.2.1.
