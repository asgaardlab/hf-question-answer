contains_question: yes

question_part: 
I just found training examples that are either in German or English language. Is that the way one makes them understand another language (i.e. german)?
Do you have some background knowledge how you come up with your approach and reasoning how you decide what data to use and how you want make the model usable in german?
Do you checked the quality? Any metrics to measure your results?
