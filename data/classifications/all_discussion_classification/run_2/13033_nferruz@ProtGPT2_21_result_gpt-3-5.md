contains_question: yes

question_part: I was wondering if it is possible to generate a sequence by conserving the end of the sequence (rather than the beginning, which is possible if you provide the beginning of the sequence for ProtGPT to complete). Any other thoughts on how one would go about conserving the end of a sequence?
