contains_question: yes
question_part: I noticed that the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" model has a Wer of '4.8385', which is lower than the Wer of '5.590' achieved by the "whisper-large-v2-pt" model. Does this mean that the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" model has outperformed the "whisper-large-v2-pt" model?
