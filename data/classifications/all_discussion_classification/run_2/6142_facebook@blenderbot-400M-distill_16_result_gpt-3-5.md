contains_question: yes

question_part: I get "sequence length is longer than the specified maximum sequence length for this model (146 > 128). Running this sequence through the model will result in indexing errors" when my question is too long, I tried to changed the max_length in chat_pipeline but I'm not sure it's there that I should change the parameters, How could I change the code to be able to ask huge questions
