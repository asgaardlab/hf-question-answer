contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm not sure that I understand well how is the probability value calculated.
It tends to be 1 if it's aerobic and 0 for anaerobic, do you apply a threshold at which point you consider the prediction to not be "acceptable"?
I have some probability values of 0.6, 0.3, or 0.2 for example and I gather if the values are above or below 0.5 is when the program choose to categorize the aerobicity.
