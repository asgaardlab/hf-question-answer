question_part: Hi, I read your source code in github, if I understand correct from the customized trainer.py, the expand layer is only modify specify layer. While reading your paper, you are adding layers on top instead fine tune specified layer. So want to clarify if i misunderstood your approach. Appreciate for your insights. Interesting works!
