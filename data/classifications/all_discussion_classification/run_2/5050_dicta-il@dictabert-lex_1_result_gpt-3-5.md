contains_question: yes

question_part: How can I extract, in addition to the model predictions, the last layer of the model. To be more specifically, since this is a Bert structure model, 1. How can I extract the Output hidden state corresponding to [CLS] ? 2. How can I extract the Output hidden state of every other token ?
