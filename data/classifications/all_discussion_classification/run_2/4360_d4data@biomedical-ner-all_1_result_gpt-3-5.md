contains_question: yes

question_part: It is mentioned in the model description that, it has been trained such that it can recognize 107 entities. But in the config file, we can see up to 83 entities, which are nothing but 41 entities with their B and I tags. Can I please get an understanding of the number of entities the model can recognize, their names along with their definitions? Or could somebody point me in the right direction as I feel I'm missing out on something?
