contains_question: yes
question_part: Is there a way to easily import the most recent checkpoints from [lukewys/laion_clap](https://huggingface.co/lukewys/laion_clap/tree/main) in this pipeline?
I think you did it already with the older checkpoints from the same source so you must have the state_dict keys mapping saved somewhere (?)
