contains_question: yes

question_part: 
- This model card is awesome, and it would be great to build it out even more! Could you share details to estimate the CO2 emissions, like the training time, cloud provider and compute region?
- Also, the model card for the roBERTa base model (https://huggingface.co/roberta-base) talks about how bias issues with roBERTa will affect fine tuned versions of the model, too. Are there resources we can use to better understand potential biases associated with this model?
