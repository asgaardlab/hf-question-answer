contains_question: yes
question_part: Can you create a version of this model fine-tuned for Romanian language too ?
Do you consider to use mistral instead of lama 2 as base model (because mistral is more advanced that llama 2 and it is competely free to use ) ?
If yes can you make a romanian version for it ?
