contains_question: yes

question_part: I am wondering what is KMMLU in the model card? i guess that should be a korean MMLU as an evaluation metric, but then why this model works little bit lower than original model? And how could you sure both "korean and english" performance is good enouogh? Can you disclose more evaluation results related to korean language generation? Or simple inference code for korean response generation.
