contains_question: yes

question_part: I saw an earlier thread that said the demo would fit on 24GB of VRAM, and I was wondering how you achieved that? I set max split size to try and alleviate the issue but it still seems to be just shy of enough VRAM even with everything closed and im just triggering the code from the command line. Would appreciate any advice. It seems like its a stretch if loaded in 8-bit.
