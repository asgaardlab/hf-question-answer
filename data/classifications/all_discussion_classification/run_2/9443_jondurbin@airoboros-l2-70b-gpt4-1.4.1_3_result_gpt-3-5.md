contains_question: yes

question_part: I don't see weight model.layers.0.self_attn.rotary_emb.inv_freq in pytorch_model.bin.index.json even though it is present in the llama-2 index (and in the other l2 airoboros models). Not sure if it is an issue with the model or with something I'm doing, but if anyone has successfully used with TGI and could point me in the right direction I'd appreciate it!
