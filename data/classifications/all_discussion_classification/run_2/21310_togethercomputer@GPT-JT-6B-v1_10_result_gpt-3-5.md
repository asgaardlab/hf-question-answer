contains_question: yes
question_part: Will it be possible to create/train a model that doesn't train with facts. But only on language structure. For instance: Instead of training using: "Issac Newton formulated the theory of Gravity". Can't we train using: "\<PERSON_NAME\> formulated the theory of \<CONCEPT\>" If possible, I think we can still capture the language structure but dramatically reduce the model size?
