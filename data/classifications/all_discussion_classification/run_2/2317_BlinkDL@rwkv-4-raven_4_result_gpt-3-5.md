Verse 1:
Jellybeans, they're the finest in town
It's the color of sunshine, it's the taste of sweetest fruit
When you bite into one, you know it's right
A flavor that never fades away
Chorus:
Jellybeans, jellybeans, jellybeans so sweet
Jellybeans, jellybeans, they make my day
Jellybeans, jellybeans, you can't go wrong
Jellybeans, jellybeans, they're the perfect snack
Verse 2:
Jellybeans, they're like a snack that lasts forever
They can satisfy a hunger without any hassle
They come in all colors and all shapes
It's like having dessert for breakfast or tea
Chorus:
Jellybeans, they're the finest in town
Jellybeans, they're the best thing to eat
Jellybeans, they're the happiest thing that I know
Jellybeans, you can't go wrong
Bridge:
Jellybeans are like diamonds in the rough
They are tasty and satisfying every time
They can satisfy even the pickiest of minds
They're perfect for everyone no matter what's your size
Chorus:
Jellybeans, they're the finest in town
Jellybeans, it's the taste that never fades away
Jellybeans, they're like a snack that never fails
Jellybeans, you can't go wrong with these jolly beans!
Bridge:
So if you're looking for something to satisfy your cravings or just want to make your day complete
I recommend trying out some Jellybeans! They're sure to please!
Remember to be safe and enjoy your snacks with care!
