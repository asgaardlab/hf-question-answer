contains_question: yes

question_part: I'm getting this error when trying to download with Diffusers:
ValueError: unet\models.unet.py as defined in `model_index.json` does not exist in motexture/vseq2vseq and is not a module in 'diffusers/pipelines'.
When comparing with ex. Zeroscope, this line is set to "diffusers" instead of "models.unet"
