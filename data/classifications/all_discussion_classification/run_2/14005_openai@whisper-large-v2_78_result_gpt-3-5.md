contains_question: yes

question_part: Good day, what is the correct way to perform fine-tuning for the task of automatic speech recognition for two languages? Are there any peculiarities? If I do the fine-tuning for Russian and then for English. Will the second fine-tuning for English affect the quality of recognition of Russian? How do you do it right?
