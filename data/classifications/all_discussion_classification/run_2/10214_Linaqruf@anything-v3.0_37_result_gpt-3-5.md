contains_question: yes
question_part: It turns out that when trying to create a model with anything v3.0 or V3-1 I get an error that says "unexpected keyword argument 'scale' " I have no idea what it means, Google translation (with which I am writing this) tells me that it is an error related to the inclusion of the words "scale" as an argument.
