contains_question: yes
question_part: I'm currently exploring various techniques to optimize and improve our model's performance, and one question arose in our discussions: If we take a model that has already undergone distillation and then distill it again, would this lead to better results compared to just fine-tuning the original model? Has anyone here tried this approach before? If so, could you share your findings?
