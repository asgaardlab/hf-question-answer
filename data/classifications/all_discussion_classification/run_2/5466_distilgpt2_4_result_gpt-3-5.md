question_part: How did you make the tflite model? 

I want to convert your model and make it smaller and try it as the 16 bit floating point or 8bit versions, as that tflite android project does with the real gpt2, but I don't know what you did to create your tflite model. Is there a repo somewhere? Or could you upload the script that did it? Thanks!
