contains_question: yes

question_part: I was curious if you are planning to support [AutoModelForSequenceClassification](https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification) HuggingFace API on CodeGen models? 
If yes, do you have a rough timeline on when you might consider implementing the support for AutoModelForSequenceClassification?
