contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I noticed you posted an experimental merged model that incorporates Animelike2.5D. I was hoping to experiment with Animelike2.5D on my own, but it seems to have been taken down everywhere. If you still have the base model Animelike2.5D and would be willing to share it privately with me for noncommercial research purposes, I would greatly appreciate it. If not, no problem, I understand. In any case, thanks for your contributions to the community!
