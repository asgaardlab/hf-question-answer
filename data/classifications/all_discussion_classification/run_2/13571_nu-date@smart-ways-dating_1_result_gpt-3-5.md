a) *Be Proactive*: Take the initiative to start conversations with people who catch your interest. Waiting for others to reach out may limit your opportunities.
b) *Stay Open-Minded*: Be willing to explore different profiles and consider connecting with people who may not fit your initial criteria. You might discover unexpected compatibility.
c) *Respect Boundaries*: While it's essential to be proactive, also respect others' boundaries. If someone isn't interested, gracefully accept their decision and move on.
