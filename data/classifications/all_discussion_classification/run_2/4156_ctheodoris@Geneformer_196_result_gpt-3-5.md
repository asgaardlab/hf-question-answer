contains_question: yes

question_part: However, I found the results differ a lot from those in table12, the sheet "DCM_del_tx", typically by the low absolute value of shift_to_goal_end and shift_to_alt_end. 

For example, I got "ADGRL3 ENSG00000150471 6.18E-05 -6.88E-06" with 883 detections from a max_5000_cells file, but the one in sheet DCM_del_tx is "ENSG00000150471 ADGRL3 0.010678123 -0.026562714" with 1880 detections, showing a 1000 times lower shift in my results. Could you tell me what would be the possible causes? Thank you!
