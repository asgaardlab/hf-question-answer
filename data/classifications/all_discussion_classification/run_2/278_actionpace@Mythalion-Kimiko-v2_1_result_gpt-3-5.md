contains_question: yes

question_part: How come nobody noticed this!?
I can't believe you've quantized a version of Mythalion with Kimiko v2 which supports an 8K context and nobody's noticed it!?
For that matter I'm surprised nobody noticed there was a Mythalion Kimiko v2 out at all!
Given that Kimiko is routinely rolled in with MythoMax to improve it (so common to see people pushing MythoMax Kimiko over the original), and Mythalion is considered a step up from MythoMax too, i'm surprised nobody noticed a Mythalion blended with Kimiko!
How was an 8K context achieved with this? I thought MythoMax only supported 4K? Or was it capable of more all along? Is it the addition of Kimiko that makes a difference here or did you do something else to come up with the 8K GGUF? Have you actively used this model yourself and how did you find it against MythoMax, Mythalion, and other models around at the time / since?
I've been using the 8K GGUF of this, and it's working great under Faraday for me so far! It seems more soulful/warm in SFW and a little spicier in NSFW. Would love to hear from you on this model, and surprised it hasn't received more attention!
