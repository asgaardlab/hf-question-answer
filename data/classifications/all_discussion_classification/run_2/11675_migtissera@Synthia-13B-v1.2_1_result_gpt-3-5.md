contains_question: yes

question_part: @TheBloke New, improved release! Would be much appreciated if you could quantize this as well. Thanks as always to everyone involved! By the way, the 34B version was pulled for quality reasons, this is the successor. Not sure how you handle that case, just wanted to let you know.
