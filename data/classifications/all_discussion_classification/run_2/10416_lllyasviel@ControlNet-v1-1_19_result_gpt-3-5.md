question_part: Which I am unable to get by python. Curious enough is that if I use the web gradio I can get the generated image by right clicking on it as: https://helloonbelai-controlnet-v1-1.hf.space/file=/tmp/gradio/33bcf09c6d0a20069cb70ea77e6161822773b72b/image.png I tried replacing the path generated by python on the url and still I am not able to get into the image The browser will return something like {"detail":"File not found: /tmp/gradio/c99171c1-2e19-4ad4-8e91-156572bac6ff/image.png."}
