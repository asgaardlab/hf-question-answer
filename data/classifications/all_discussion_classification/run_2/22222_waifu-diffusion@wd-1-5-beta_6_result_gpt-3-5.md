contains_question: yes

question_part: How were the Release Note examples generated? How cherry-picked are the examples in the "[Release Notes](https://cafeai.notion.site/WD-1-5-Beta-2-Release-Notes-2852db5a9cdd456ba52fc5730b91acfd)"? Can you provide me all the generation hyperparameters, including the seed? Thanks. What am I doing wrong?
