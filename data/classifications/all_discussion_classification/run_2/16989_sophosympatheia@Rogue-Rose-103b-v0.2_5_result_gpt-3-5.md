contains_question: yes
question_part: 
- If you don't mind, I have a question about recommended formatting as well, specifically for description, greeting message, and user messages.
- Do you prefer unstructured description (i.e. ordinary prose) or structured description (such as W++)?
- How do you prefer using quotes and asterisks? Novelistic style (`I do an action. "Hello."`), roleplay style (`*Action.* Hello.`), or something else?
- My impression is that the usual choice here is third-person pronouns in all cases aside from the user referring to themselves in first person. Do you use that style or something else?
