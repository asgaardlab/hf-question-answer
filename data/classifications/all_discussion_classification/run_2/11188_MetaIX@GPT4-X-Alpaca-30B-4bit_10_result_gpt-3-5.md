contains_question: yes
question_part: What model_type to set between "None" and "llama"? And what prompt style to use? There are plenty of the latter in Ooba's TextGenWebUI as of now and I'm pretty much lost (see pics for clarification) Also if these infos are generally available somewhere in the config files of the repo and I can find them autonomously please let me know so I won't bother you all ever again with these noob-ish questions, thank you!
