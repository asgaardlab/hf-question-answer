contains_question: yes

question_part: As you mentioned in your paper, the training set of following benchmark dataset was used during training;
I am wondering that
1) Did you use 100 negative sample for the dataset without hard negatives?
2) Which benchmark dataset did you use mE5 for negative sampling? I might guess all the dataset without MS MARCO, MR. TyDi and T2Ranking, but i am not certain.
