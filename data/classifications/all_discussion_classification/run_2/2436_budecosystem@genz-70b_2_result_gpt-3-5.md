contains_question: yes

question_part: 
While roleplaying where it is supposed to stay in character, if we say something like 'Are you in US?' It responds with 'Nope! I am a language model developed by researchers from Bud Ecosystem.' despite having mentioned in the prompt to stay in character and not respond as an AI. Also is there a way to restrict the model from generating output only under x number of characters/words? for ex. only generate output under 10 words
