question_part: 
Hi, I would like to use the adapter_model.bin file in Whisper, but it seems the model it used is called large-v2.pt. I wonder how do I convert this so that it can be used in Whisper installation?
If I want to use both, how do i convert model.bin into format that whisper-cpp and OpenAI whisper to use?
