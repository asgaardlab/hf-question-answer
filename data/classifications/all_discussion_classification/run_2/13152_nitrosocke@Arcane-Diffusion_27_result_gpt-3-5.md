contains_question: yes

question_part: The League of Legends spin-off Legends of Runeterra has a lot of great art for the cards (all widescreen except for spells unfortunately) and have the same general style, but with some more variety in content. Like boats and dragons and bears, fantasy and steampunk and pirates, etc.
