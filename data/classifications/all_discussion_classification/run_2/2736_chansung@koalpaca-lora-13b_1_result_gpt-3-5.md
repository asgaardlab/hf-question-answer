contains_question: yes

question_part: could you please guide me on how can I load this model on my computer(locally) to test how it works, I tried to use the pipeline, or even using torch and load_state_dict, but none of them worked for me to load this model on my system, could you please provide some guidance on how to get your model up and running?
