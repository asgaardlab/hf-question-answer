contains_question: yes

question_part: Assuming this model followed the same principle, the question is what dataset was used to make this model, and how was it obtained  Such dataset seems pretty hard to manually create (and this seems unlikely that tens of thousands of such images were created, which is known to be the minimal amount for training a controlNet). So what was the dataset and how was it created/obtained. Assuming this model didn't precisely follow this principle, what were the changes and what tricks were used to make it work?
