contains_question: yes
question_part: 
1. I found that the result csv file only contains cosine similarity but no p-value and FDR. How can I get the p-value and FDR?
2. If I want to study how the expression/embedding of the remaining genes changes after a single gene is deleted, how should I do it?
3. Suppose I have a list of multiple genes and want to study the results of perturbation of each gene individually and generate a csv containing the perturbation of each gene in the list.
