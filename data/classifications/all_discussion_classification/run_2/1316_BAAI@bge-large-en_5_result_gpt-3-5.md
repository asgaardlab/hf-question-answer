contains_question: yes

question_part: What should be the instructions for use cases like intent classification where we have to find embeddings of intent name, intent description, intent example sentences and the unknown sentence for which the intent needs to be found out using cosine similarity? 
Are there specific instructions which were used to the train the model for different tasks?
