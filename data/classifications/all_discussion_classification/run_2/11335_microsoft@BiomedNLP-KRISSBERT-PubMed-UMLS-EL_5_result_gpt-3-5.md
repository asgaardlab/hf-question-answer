contains_question: yes

question_part: As stated in the readme, the top-1 accuracy for the full MM dataset is 58.3%. In comparison, the paper states that the accuracy should be 70.7% for the lazy supervised apporach (https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07887.pdf Table 2). Can you please tell us why there is this (large) discrepancy between these two performances. Are there any important "components" missing from this model compared to the model you used to analyze the statistics in the publication?
