contains_question: yes

question_part: Hi, I used **ctransformer** to load __PhoGPT-7B5-Instruct-q5_0.gguf__ but I got the exception: **RuntimeError: Failed to create LLM 'mpt'**. I also tried using **PhoGPT-7B5-Instruct-q5_k_m.gguf** instead but got the same error. Do you know the reason and the way to fix it
