contains_question: yes

question_part: I see that even using the GPU the model still uses a little of the CPU cores, in the image to see that it is mainly limited to one core at 100%, would it be possible to make the model stop using the CPU or force it to use all the nuclei at the time of processing ?
Another question is whether it is normal for him to alternately use the GPUs, it is a little clearer in this image
Can you see that it uses some gpus but the others are stopped temporarily, is it a normal behavior of the model
