contains_question: yes

question_part: It feels smarter than even llama 30b models I have interacted with. But it has a surprising low score on openLLM leaderboard despite this figure: reporting near parity with chatgpt. One source of this is that gsm8k seems to be reported as 26.84 on the best run in openLLM leaderboard, whereas on your chart I think it is reported as 77.3 (or at least greater than 62.4). What's the story here? I'm ready to believe based on my interaction with this that its better than the leaderboard score would indicate, but I'm curious why there might be mismatch.
