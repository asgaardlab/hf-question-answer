          prefixing generated responses rather than the name of the bot''s character.
          Is this telling me something?</p>

          <p>Along similar lines, is it effective to use "You" to indicate the user
          in the bot character''s definition? For example, say the bot character is
          "Bob" and you put "Bob loves You" in the character definition. Does that
          have an effect in that the LM knows that "You" is the user?</p>

          <p>And if there is more up-to-date docs on your syntax, just let me know
          and I''ll read it! :) </p>
