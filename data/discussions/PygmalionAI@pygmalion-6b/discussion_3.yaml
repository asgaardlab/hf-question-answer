          <p>As for the training data ideas, I''d say no because you need more chat
          like data, that''s why this one is so much better at chatting than OPT or
          BLOOM. This is the core of why this one works and using misc papers and
          documents will drag down the performance you''re looking for in the realm
          of chatting. This model still manages to out perform OPT and others logical
          questions and moral questions and cognition tests I''ve run so the best
          thing to do is probably just keep doing what''s been working, improve it
          obviously but don''t throw random documents in. </p>

          <p>For training I don''t know if you can distribute that over the internet,
          but you can run the model using sharding, so that you can break it apart
          onto the gpu, cpu, and disk if necessary. 11b would still be a good step
          up and could run on a mid-higher end gaming PC.</p>

  content: "> Hey 11b how much more compute power do we need? Is there anyway to create\
    \ a distributed network aka folding at home style that chops up fine tuning into\
    \ smaller chunks? If we could even get 200 folks with old af 10xx series cards\
