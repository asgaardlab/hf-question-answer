          \ can create AIs of all types (not only Pygmalion characters) for free and\
          \  with no code or advanced knowledge requiered and then share or sell them\
          \ with even a free API they can use on their own websites or apps. That\
          \ will mean users won\u2019t need to self host Pygmalion if they don\u2019\
          t want to use Colab or spend money on paid GPU/CPU/IPU, want it running\
          \ 24/7 or want to integrate it as a Discord chatbot or any other thing Currently\
          \ the AIs there will be hosted in an IPU or CPU machine, as I don\u2019\
          t yet have a GPU machine to have 24/7 on, so I will work on a way to use\
          \ transformers  to host Pygmalion on CPU/IPU. I will also report any bugs\
          \ or issues I find in the Pygmalion model and (if you want them) usage statistics\
          \ and reports. You will also get part of the earnings we get from the platform\
          \ (we can discuss how much). If you could also promote the website at the\
          \ GitHub repository and the huggingface model for people to use it instead\
          \ of Colab or other limited platforms I will be very happy. What do you\
          \ think about helping with me with this? I will release it soon (in 1 month\
          \ aproximately), so please answer as soon as possible so I can have in count\
          \ if you will try to help me integrate Pygmalion into the platform and promote\
          \ the project.</p>\n"
