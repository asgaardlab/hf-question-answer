          <p>I have not tried it personally, but I''ve seen a report from another
          user who used HuggingFace <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/optimum">optimum</a>
          and observed significant speedups after converting the model to an optimized
          ONNX graph through that library. The documentation there might be a good
          starting point.</p>
