        html: '<p>Hey, any idea how can we fine tune the model for different language.
          I can see the model understands different language but only reply in english.
          To test this I generated a synthetic dataset of Hinglish(hindi + english)
          from gpt4 in pygmalion format (8k training + 2k eval) and used it to make
          a lora. Although I am getting replies in Hinglish but the model is replying
          with 3-4 consecutive dialogues including mine (Character: "", you:"", character"")<br>Any
          idea what I might be doing wrong</p>
