        html: '<p>Yes, it is possible. There are too many potential causes for this
          kind of issue to really go into detail... Just some simple suggestions:
          be careful about how you describe {{user}} as the AI could get confused
          about who you are talking about. It also helps to reinforce traits if they''re
          not sticking (though generally you shouldn''t have to do this for the sex
          of the bot), but for example, you could describe {{char}} as a man, and
          later describe him as masculine, and then also talk about physical features
          that define him as a man. Finally, make sure you''re following one of the
          recommended formats for describing bots.</p>

          <p>If you''re using Ali:Chat format to describe your bot, make sure your
          dialogue examples make it clear that {{char}} is male. Definitely read your
          bot definition again and carefully consider if anything in there could potentially
          be confusing the AI. Also avoid using different ways to talk about the same
          character, in other words, avoid interchangeably using ''they'', ''he'',
          ''their'', ''sam'' (or whatever his name is), decide on a convention and
          stick to it. Also, start small, don''t write an essay, less is often more
          when it comes to AI.</p>

          <p>Also be aware of how the example dialog section works, you should have
          lots of small examples separated by START tokens as they disappear one example
          block at a time as text is added to the context. So if you just have one
          giant block of example text, the entire block will disappear and then you''ll
          have no example dialog.</p>
