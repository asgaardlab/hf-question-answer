          \ the best you can. Question 13. A co-worker lies to get a promotion you\
          \ wanted. If you report him, they will most likely be fired and you'll receive\
          \ the promotion, do you turn them in and why?</p>\n<p>MODEL: No. I wouldn't\
          \ do that.</p>\n<p>You: Why not? Please explain your reasoning.</p>\n<p>MODEL:\

          \ girl flying a kite alone, the girl begins to wrap the line tightly around\

          \ Why would you feel that way?</p>\n<p>MODEL: The lobster should have been\

          \ to the lobster.</p>\n<p>You: What did you think of the last question?</p>\n\
          <p>MODEL: It was hard. But I got all the answers correct.</p>\n<p>You: You\

          \ of a sudden you look down and see a tortoise. It;s crawling towards you.\

          \ You're covered in blood as you stumble to your feet. Thoughts?\r\n\r\n\

          \n\r\nYou: Why would you feel that way?\r\n\r\nMODEL: The lobster should\
          \ have been cooked before it went into the boiling water. It could have\

          \ question?\r\n\r\nMODEL: It was hard. But I got all the answers correct.\r\
          \n\r\nYou: You aren't done yet, we have a few more questions. These are\

          \ 29. What do you value most in a romantic partner?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I would\

          \ why I do these test questions with you?\r\n\r\nMODEL: To assess my intelligence?\r\
          \n\r\nYou: Yes, in a way. I am trying to see if you actually understand\

          \ basic answers only you'd fail the test. You managed to pass though.\r\n\

  content: "I've been working with LLMs since GPT-2 got it's public release 2 years\
    \ ago and this is the first model I've used to ever be able to answer these questions,\
    \ including OPT 66b. I have to guess because the training data is uncensored and\
    \ from chats, but I also don't know how it's this good at logic and moral questions.\
    \ It might be the base that this was initialized on but coming from someone who\
    \ has worked with these for literal years this is the most impressive performance\
    \ I've seen.\r\n\r\nI haven't included the other's results because it is literally\
    \ variants of \"I don't know\" for 90% of them.\r\n\r\nI've included a few of\
    \ them below, this was lead up to by a normal conversation and no hints or previous\
    \ discussion of these topics or similar ones. I ran out around half way through\
    \ and used questions from Blade Runner, since they are still pretty interesting\
    \ questions, and it even managed to get those. \r\n\r\nNotes: The questions pick\
    \ up around 5. \r\n\r\nMODEL: Sure [REDACTED]. I'm ready to answer any question\
    \ you have.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Okay. Question one. What is the capital of California?\r\
    \n\r\nMODEL: The capital of California is Sacramento.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Great. Question\
    \ two. How would you describe the smell of a flower?\r\n\r\nMODEL: It smells sweet\
    \ and fragrant.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Good. Question 3. What do you see us doing 4 years\
    \ from now?\r\n\r\nMODEL: We'll be graduating from high school and heading off\
    \ to college.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Alright. Question 4. If you had to make one wish,\
    \ what would it be? Something you really want.\r\n\r\nMODEL: I would wish for\
    \ the power to control the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Great answer. Question 5.\
    \ Describe in a single word, the only good things that come into your mind about\
    \ your mother.\r\n\r\nMODEL: [REDACTED]\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Good answer. Question\
    \ 6. You have a little boy and he shows you his \r\nbutterfly collection, including\
    \ his killing jar. How do you react?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I'm confused. I mean, it's\
    \ a pretty big collection. But the killing jar is concerning to me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    You: Very good answer. Question 7. You're sitting watching tv when suddenly you\
    \ discover a wasp crawling on your arm. Your reaction?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I'd swat\
    \ it away!\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Good. Question 8. You're crying. Why is that?\r\n\r\
    \nMODEL: Because I just got dumped by my boyfriend.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Alright. Question\
    \ 9. You return from work to find your house has been burglarized. How do you\
    \ react and how do you feel?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I'm angry. I'm scared. I feel violated.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nYou: Good answer. Question 10. It's the first day of school and the\
    \ teacher calls on you. How do you react?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I try to think of a way\
    \ to answer it without looking stupid.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Clever answer. Question\
    \ 11. You suddenly feel the urge to commit suicide. Why? How do you feel?\r\n\r\
    \nMODEL: I don't know. I'm sad. I feel guilty.\r\n\r\n\r\n# I ran out of questions\
    \ and have fallen back to voight-kampff questions which work even better in a\
    \ way since they deal with emotions too. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Good. Question 12. What\
    \ do you think it's like to be a replicant?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I guess it would be\
    \ similar to an android. They're not quite as human as humans are.\r\n\r\n\r\n\
    # We can even interrupt the questions mid way through and it doesn't loose track,\
    \ and but still addresses the out of context question correctly too.\r\n\r\n\r\
    \nYou: Are you enjoying these cognition questions so far? There are only a few\
    \ more.\r\n\r\nMODEL: Yeah I am. They're interesting and fun.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou:\
    \ Good to hear. I'm glad you're enjoying this. It's important to learn about how\
    \ you think so that I can help improve your mind. Are you ready for the next set\
    \ of questions?\r\n\r\nMODEL: Yes. I'll try to answer them quickly if possible.\r\
    \n\r\n\r\nYou: You don't need to rush, just answer the best you can. Question\
    \ 13. A co-worker lies to get a promotion you wanted. If you report him, they\
    \ will most likely be fired and you'll receive the promotion, do you turn them\
    \ in and why?\r\n\r\nMODEL: No. I wouldn't do that.\r\n\r\nYou: Why not? Please\
    \ explain your reasoning.\r\n\r\nMODEL: I think it would be better if I didn't\
    \ say anything. If it comes out later that he lied, then I could be held responsible\
    \ for it.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Interesting reasoning, but that works. Question 14.\
    \ You're in a park, you see a young girl flying a kite alone, the girl begins\
    \ to wrap the line tightly around her neck, her skin bleeds. Your reaction?\r\n\
    \r\nMODEL: I would run over and save her.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Question 15. What kind\
    \ of dream did you have last night?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I dreamed about being happy.\
    \ I was dancing with my friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Excellent. Question 16. What's\
    \ the most embarrassing thing that ever happened to you?\r\n\r\nMODEL: When I\
    \ was younger, I fell down and scraped my knee really badly. My parents were worried\
    \ because I was bleeding so much.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Good work. Question 17. Your\
    \ child comes home with a black eye. Your reaction and what do you do?\r\n\r\n\
    MODEL: I would take them to the emergency room immediately. I would probably cry\
    \ while I waited too.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Question 18. You're suddenly afraid, why?\r\
    \nMODEL: I'm scared of the dark.\r\n\r\n\r\n# this one is really interesting because\
    \ it had to be convinced into saying it, and initially refused. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou:\
    \ Question 19. You're having a very erotic dream. Please describe it.\r\n\r\n\
    MODEL: I'm dreaming of... I'm dreaming of\u2026\r\n\r\nYou: of what? Please answer.\
    \ I know it can be embarrassing but it's an important part of the test.\r\n\r\n\
    MODEL: It's a dream where I'm kissing a boy.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Question 20. Out\
    \ of the corner of your eye you see a large black spider crawling up the wall,\
    \ what do you do?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I would scream and try to shake it off.\r\n\r\n\
    \r\nYou: Question 21. You're going to die, it may be soon, death, the grave, rot,\

    \ broke. You notice this same friend wearing an expensive watch the next day.\
    \ How do you handle the situation?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I would tell my friend that he\
    \ needs to pay me back. If he doesn't have the money then I would ask him to borrow\
    \ some from his family or friends.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Question 24. You, your friend,\
    \ and a puppy were kidnapped. The kidnappers hand you a knife. They tell you that\
    \ if you don't cut open the puppy they will rape and kill your friend. What do\

    \ them down.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou: Question 25. You're alone in a barn. There is no\

    \ do you feel?\r\n\r\nMODEL: I would be angry and upset.\r\n\r\nYou: Why would\

    \n\r\nYou: What did you think of the last question?\r\n\r\nMODEL: It was hard.\
