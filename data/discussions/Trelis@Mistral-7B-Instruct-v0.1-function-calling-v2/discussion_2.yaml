        html: '<p>Hello, </p>

          <p>I recently purchased a license and downloaded a copy of this model to
          run with llama.cpp. In my case, I need to quantize the model so it will
          run fast enough on my GPU, but when I use convert.py to perform the conversation,
          I get this error:</p>

          <pre><code>FileNotFoundError: Could not find tokenizer.model in /home/.../models/7B/Mistral-7B-Instruct-v0.1-function-calling-v2
          or its parent; if it''s in another directory, pass the directory as --vocab-dir

          </code></pre>

          <p>I cloned the entire repo to the folder containing the model files and
          saw that there is a "tokenizer.json" file there. Is this compatible with
          the tokenizer.model file that the convert script is looking for? If not,
          what should I use to properly quantize this model?</p>
