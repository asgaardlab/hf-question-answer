        html: '<p>We have a requirement to generate SQL from natural language. We
          have used codellama/CodeLlama-13b-Instruct-hf  model, getting answers but
          understand that the model needs good amount of further tuning specific to
          our use case/questions and related schema. We have used: <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/ragntune/code-llama-finetune/blob/main/fine-tune-code-llama.ipynb">https://github.com/ragntune/code-llama-finetune/blob/main/fine-tune-code-llama.ipynb</a>
          and used our custom dataset.<br>But do''t see much improvement at all in
          the queries which were not getting answered with pre-trained model and not
          getting answered in the fine tuned model as well Those queries were specifically
          trained in the fine tuning process. </p>

          <p>What I am thinking is the fine tuned model trained properly? Is the training
          dataset correctly done?</p>

          <p>Any thoughts here?</p>
