        html: '<p>I have exactly the same thing. I used two different tutorials with
          different code both based on the fine-tuning in the falcon 7b blog post
          and one repeats additional questions and answers over and over (almost like
          it''s returning one Q&amp;A, then related Q&amp;A). The other code I tried
          today repeats over and over like this too.</p>

          <p>I''d really like some help and to see an answer on this too please and
          I''ll update if I find a solution.</p>

          <p>Frustratingly the first tutorial I followed showed a video with perfect
          inference afterwards and the code from checking looks identical.</p>
