        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for this cool fine tune, I was wondering if there is
          some remedy for the issue of ChatML taking up many tokens. For example,
          &lt;|im_end|&gt; is 7 tokens, which takes a lot of time to process. If it
          and the rest of the ChatML formatting took up only one, the speed would
          be increased a lot. Is there something I''m missing here or is it really
          supposed to be 7 tokens?</p>
