        html: '<p>Hello,<br>first I would like to really appreciate all the effort
          to build this protein language model. I would like to ask if there are some
          examples how to use your model, how to generate de novo proteins, or what
          parameters could be set up to generate these new proteins. As a ML specialist
          I see a big potential in your model, but not able to explain and show it
          easily to my colleagues (biologists) how it can be beneficial. Thank you
          for your reaction in advance.</p>
