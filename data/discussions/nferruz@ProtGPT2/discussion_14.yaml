          <p>If I feed it invalid sequence it still predicts a sequence following
          this amino acid sequence list. </p>

          <p>That is probably due to the basic model coming from chatGPT.<br>It is
          probably never an situation that someone will use this for. But I wanted
          to hear any thoughts on this. </p>

          <p>Similarly I ran the sequence on colabfold but got non converging sequence
          error. For reference:</p>

        html: '<p>Hi skr3178,</p>

          <p>Thanks for writing!<br>The model will always predict a sequence after
          an input. It is autoregressive and chooses the next token based on its context.
          In your case, the context is ''BJOUX, it has no biological meaning, but
          it still corresponds to a set of tokens. Hence, the model can compute associate
          probabilities for the tokens after that. But I can imagine that the perplexities
          for those sequences should be a bit high. If you want to avoid specific
          tokens during generation, you could use the bad_words parameter.<br>Not
          an expert on Colabfold, but what sequence did you try?<br>Thanks!<br>noelia</p>
