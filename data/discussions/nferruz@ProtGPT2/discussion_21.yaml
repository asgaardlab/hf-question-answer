        html: '<p>Hello! </p>

          <p>I was wondering if it is possible to generate a sequence by conserving
          the end of the sequence (rather than the beginning, which is possible if
          you provide the beginning of the sequence for ProtGPT to complete). </p>

          <p>I have seen some other protein generation models which were trained using
          each the sequence and it''s reverse order - if this is the case then I think
          I could just provide the end of the sequence in reverse order to generate
          new proteins - but I''m not sure if this is how ProtGPT was trained. </p>

          <p>Any other thoughts on how one would go about conserving the end of a
          sequence?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>Kathryn </p>
