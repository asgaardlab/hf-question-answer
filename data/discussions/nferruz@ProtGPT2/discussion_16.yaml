        html: "<p>Hi Leo,</p>\n<p>I haven\u2019t tried to fine-tune without the helper\
          \ script but is definitely possible. I guess once you have defined tokenizer\
          \ and model (which you do right) I would follow the tutorial. In this case\
          \ you will have to create a txt file with your sequences, replacing the\
          \ fasta headers with the endoftext tag. Then not sure how the tutorial does\
          \ it, but you\u2019ll have to tokenize, and define the splits (90/10?) for\
          \ that dataset.<br>Hope this helps<br>Noelia</p>\n"
