        html: '<p>Hi Yuanji Zhang,</p>

          <p>Thanks for your interest! I am afraid I do not have a rule of thumb yet.
          I tried to fine-tune a model with 500 sequences, and it did not work very
          well. However, I know someone who fine-tuned 900 sequences, and the training
          curves looked fine and obtained the expected results. So I guess you will
          have to try :). I am happy to assist if you need any help! </p>

          <p>Noelia</p>
