        html: '<p>Hello everyone,<br>I''ve been using BERT for token classification
          and fine tuned it to address my problem, which was basically adding some
          more tags to the already existing list of tags of the model.<br>The fine
          tuning worked well and the model is performing pretty good, however, after
          investigation, I''ve noticed obvious misses. I want now to fine tune again
          the version of the BERT model that I already have on a smaller but more
          targeted dataset specific to the misses that I have noticed. </p>

          <p>When going through the exact same process as the first fine-tuning, the
          model lost all the good prediction that it used to do and turned into rubbish
          results. </p>

          <p>Does anyone has an idea on how to fine tune the BERT model on a smaller
          dataset  ? </p>

          <p>Thank you for your help !  </p>
