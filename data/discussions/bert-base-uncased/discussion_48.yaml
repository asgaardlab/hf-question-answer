        html: '<p>Good day</p>

          <p>I''ve noticed that BERT''s MLM (bert-base-uncased) loss is approximately
          2.5 on wikipedia dataset on which it was trained. However, the original
          paper reported ~4 perplexity, i.e. loss ~1.38.<br>I continue learning it
          using run_mlm.py script. MLM loss decreased to 1.8 for 10000 steps.<br>May
          anybody explain why this checkpoint has a such big loss?</p>
