        html: '<p>Based on the discussion here (<a href="https://huggingface.co/bert-base-german-dbmdz-uncased/discussions/1">https://huggingface.co/bert-base-german-dbmdz-uncased/discussions/1</a>),
          we think this is the same model as <a href="https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased">https://huggingface.co/dbmdz/bert-base-german-cased</a>.
          If that''s true, could you merge this PR which adds a note to the model
          card for this model making the relationship clear? Thanks!</p>
