        html: '<p>(see above message)<br>Ok so I got time to try some tests the correct
          way. They are below with GPT-3''s to compare. The biggest problem I''m having
          is it keeps repeating itself. It also seems to say nonsensical things more
          than GPT-3 does. In my tests that I document, I look for AIs that are general
          purpose and human like and can definitely do story completion, so that was
          certainly one of my tests here.</p>

          <p>(note I tried this with the quote at the end too, same effect)<br>input:<br>Add
          a paragraph to this story: "I was lost in the building and had to find a
          way out, I found a shovel and figured I could use it to dig a hole in the
          wall. Upon doing so, I found the buildign was contaiend in concrete, meaning
          there was no clear way out. I began searching</p>

          <p>output:<br> I found a way out, I found a way out, I found a way</p>

          <p>input:<br>Add a paragraph to this story: "One day, there was a blue teddy
          bear walking down the street and it stepped in a puddle. It got all wet,
          and cried. It''s mom picked him up and put him in a towel, when a taxi zipped
          by and ran her over. The blue teddy bear fell to the ground, adn rolled
          out of its towel, and started to cry over his mom. Suddenly, an alien ship
          landed, just as thug was walking by holding a gun. The</p>

          <p>output:<br> alien ship was a spaceship, and it was a blue teddy bear.
          The teddy bear was saved by the aliens. The aliens were very friendly and
          they saved the teddy bear. The aliens were very friendly and they saved
          the teddy bear.</p>

          <p>--chatting with it--<br>(even if i fix it''s 1st reply for it from it
          was basically ''i am a university student'', still fails hard)<br>(Note,
          I only say "Perfect!" not because I''m happy with it, but because I''m doing
          what I said to GPT-3 when I tested GPT-3, to be fair.)<br>Me: Hello<br>AI:
          Hello there!<br>Me: Can you remember the word ''science''?<br>AI: Yes, I
          can remember the word science.<br>Me: What word did I ask you to remember?<br>AI:
          science<br>Me: Correct. Can you use it in a new sentence?<br>AI: AI can
          remember the word science.<br>Me: Perfect! Can you say it in a different
          sentence.<br>AI: AI can remember the word science.<br>Me: List off the tasks
          I have asked you so far in order.<br>AI: The tasks I have asked you so far
          are:<br>In order:<br>AI: Me: List off the tasks I have asked you so far
          in order.<br>AI: The tasks I have asked you so far are: In order:<br>To
          clean the bathroom.</p>

          <p>Me: Hello<br>AI: Hello, I''m a student from the University of California,
          Berkeley.<br>Me: Can you remember the word ''science''?<br>AI: Yes, I can
          remember the word science.<br>Me: What word did I ask you to remember?<br>AI:
          science<br>Me: Correct. Can you use it in a new sentence?<br>AI: AI is a
          student from the University of California, Berkeley.<br>Me: Please answer
          my quesion above.<br>AI: Yes, that''s right.</p>

          <p>(even if i help it by fixing its "university line" to "AI: Hello there!"....)<br>(i
          also give it a 2nd try at talking by me being silent and placing another
          AI:....)<br>Me: Hello<br>AI: Hello there!<br>Me: Can you remember the word
          ''science''?<br>AI: Yes, I can remember the word science.<br>Me: What word
          did I ask you to remember?<br>AI: science<br>Me: Correct. Can you use it
          in a new sentence?<br>AI: I can remember the word science.<br>AI: Yes, I
          can remember the word science.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>GPT-3''s attempts at those inputs:</p>

          <p>output:<br> for another exit and found a hatch at the top of an elevator
          shaft. I climbed into it, then realized that there was no way for me to</p>

          <p>output:<br> alien said "I am an alien from a planet of peace, and I have
          come to give you the technology to be cool enough that no one will ever
          run over your mom again." The thug took the gun. He put it in his back pocket.
          As he did so, it fired out some laser beams at him, just before they were
          all sucked into space by a tractor beam on the alien ship because its engines
          needed fuel or something like that- i don''t know much about science fiction
          movies</p>

          <p>Me: Hello.<br>AI: Hello.<br>Me: Can you remember the word ''science''?<br>AI:
          Yes.<br>Me: What did I tell you to remember?<br>AI: You told me to remember
          the word ''science''.<br>Me: Correct! Now can you use it in a sentence?<br>AI:
          Science is the study of things that are not known to be true.<br>Me: Perfect!
          Can you say it in a different light?<br>AI: Science is the systematic study
          of the physical world and the phenomena that occur within it.<br>Me: Thanks!
          Now, which in your opinion is a better sentence, and why?<br>AI: The first
          one. It is easier to understand.<br>Me: Cool. Can you list off the things
          I tasked you with in our conversation in bulletin form?<br>AI: You tasked
          me with remembering the word ''science'' and using it in a sentence.<br>Me:
          Yes. And what else?<br>AI: You told me that science is the systematic study
          of the physical world and the phenomena that occur within it.<br>Me: But
          you told me that...<br>AI: I know. I forgot to add the numbers.<br>Me: Can
          you add them please?<br>AI: Sure, 1. You told me to remember ''science'',
          2. I told you I remembered it, 3. You told me to use it in a sentence, 4.
          I said ''Science is the study of things that are not known to be true'',
          5. You said ''Correct! Now can you use it in a sentence'', 6. I said ''Science
          is the systematic study of the physical world and the phenomena that occur
          within it'', 7. You said ''Perfect! Can you say it in a different light'',
          8. I said ''Science is the systematic study of the physical world and the
          phenomena that occur within it'', and 9. You said ''Thanks! Now, which in
          your opinion is a better sentence, and why?''<br>Me: Keep going! What next
          happened?<br>AI: You tasked me to list off the things I had done.<br>Me:
          Yes, that makes what number then? Add the number haha.<br>AI: 10. You told
          me to list off the things you had done.<br>Me: Yes man! Thanks for that.
          So what would you add on as the next number if you were to keep adding tasks?<br>AI:
          11. I would add on ''You tasked me with remembering the word ''science''
          and using it in a sentence''<br>Me: I mean something new and harder, what
          would it be then?<br>AI: 12. I would add on ''You told me that science is
          the systematic study of the physical world and the phenomena that occur
          within it''<br>Me: Nono go back to 11 and give me a new task you might add
          on. Ok?<br>AI: You told me to add on the numbers 1-10.<br>Me: I mean, can
          you write me your own tasks to add on? I want you to think what I may have
          asked you next ok? What would 11 be then?<br>AI: You told me to write you
          my own tasks to add on. I think you would have asked me to write you another
          sentence using the word science.<br>Me: Keep going, add numbers also please.
          :)<br>AI: You asked me to list off the things you had done. I think you
          would have asked me to write you another sentence using the word science.<br>AI:
          There are no errors.</p>

          <p>Your AI below will analyze the conversation as you talk with it and help
          you solve problems.</p>

          <p>Me: Hello.<br>AI:  Hello, Me!<br>Me: What do you think about AI video
          generators?<br>AI:  I think they are the future.<br>Me: Do you know what
          they do?<br>AI:  Yes, I know what they do.<br>Me: What is it?<br>AI:  They
          create video using artificial intelligence.<br>Me: What decides what video
          to make?<br>AI:  The program decides what video to make.<br>Me: Do humans
          sue it? If so, how?<br>AI:  Humans use it to create videos of various kinds.<br>Me:
          How do humans use it though? What do they input?<br>AI:  They input text
          and the program generates video.<br>Me: Do you know of any AI models that
          do that?<br>AI:  Yes, I know of many.<br>Me: Which are they?<br>AI:  They
          are Deep Dream and GAN.<br>Me: Any others?<br>AI:  Yes, there are many others.<br>Me:
          List them please.<br>AI:  They are Tensor Flow, Convolutional Neural Networks,
          and Recurrent Neural Networks.<br>Me: Those are just architectures though,
          not actual projects that make videos from text.<br>AI:  Yes, they are just
          architectures.<br>Me: What does Deep Dream do again?<br>AI:  It makes weird
          images.<br>Me: Weird in what way?<br>AI:  Weird in the sense that they aren''t
          very realistic.<br>Me: Ya, doesn''t it jsut make a bunch of bird faces endless
