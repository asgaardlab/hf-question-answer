        html: '<p>Hi, I hope this message finds you well. I recently noticed the license
          change for your model on Hugging Face, and I wanted to seek some clarification
          on a few points:</p>

          <p>Given your profile information, it seems that the model is finetuned/dreamboothed
          based on an official stable diffusion checkpoint. As such, it inherently
          shares similarities with numerous other models.</p>

          <p>Firstly, I would like to inquire about your definition of a "derivative"
          for basil-mix:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>If a model is finetuned from basil-mix, to what extent does it qualify
          as a derivative? I presume you might use metrics such as SVD distance to
          assess "similarity."</li>

          <li>If a model is partially merged with basil-mix, what percentage of incorporation
          would classify it as a derivative? For instance, would you consider OrangeMix
          to fall within the scope of your derivative, thus prohibiting commercial
          use?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Furthermore, I am curious about the implications of the license change
          for existing models/products/illustrations created before the change:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Are fanbox owners required to remove previously published works in light
          of the new license terms?</li>

          <li>Must published or printed AI artworks be revoked to comply with the
          updated license?</li>

          <li>Do heavily human-modified artworks or i2i''ed images count as creations
          of your model? Can your model be utilized as an intermediate step in the
          creation process without being subject to licensing terms?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Finally, I would like to address the validity of the license:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Does the license provide me with a guarantee that you will support me
          in the event of any copyright infringement claims arising from the use of
          your model?</li>

          <li>Are there any copyrighted materials utilized as training data for the
          model, which you do not own and that could potentially pose issues if I
          were to use your model commercially?</li>

          <li>If I purchase a license from you for $1,000 per month, would I be able
          to distribute another model similar to yours under a free distribution license,
          while maintaining compliance with your licensing terms?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Your attention to these matters would be greatly appreciated. Thank you
          for considering my inquiries, and I hope you have a pleasant day.<br>Sincerely,</p>

          <p>Kirisaki Yamato</p>
