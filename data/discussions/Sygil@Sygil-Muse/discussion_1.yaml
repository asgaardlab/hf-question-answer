          to run the code, then you can use the <code>train_muse_vae.py</code> and
          <code>train_muse_maskgit.py</code> scripts as mentioned on the readme.md,
          what we have added is mostly QOL stuff like extra arguments to have options
          to customize most of the training parameters, you can just use the <code>--help</code>

          the training scripts for more info on things. If you want you can join <a
