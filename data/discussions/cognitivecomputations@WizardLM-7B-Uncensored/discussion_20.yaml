          <p>When it comes to anything beyond those tasks, I might as well be a chimpanzee

          me. </p>

          <p>Do I download every single file on the "files and versions" tab?<br>Do
          I use this thing in my Chrome browser?<br>Or do I download it like iTunes
          and use it offline?</p>

          <p>Believe it or not, I''m 29.  But I need someone to explain this to me
          like I am 65 .  This page: <a href="https://huggingface.co/ehartford/WizardLM-7B-Uncensored">https://huggingface.co/ehartford/WizardLM-7B-Uncensored</a></p>

          <p>Looks like another language and I don''t know what to do!</p>

          <p>Any help would be greatly appreciated.<br>Thanks </p>

          Look up a tutorial on how to use the ''oogabooga text-generation-webui''
          and if you have a decent enough PC you should be able to get it running.
          If you don''t have a very good PC you can look up a google colab notebook

          the examples and then my own prompt, it was seriously way too slow.<br>I
          feel like I could go to bed and wake up 8 hours later to see the response
