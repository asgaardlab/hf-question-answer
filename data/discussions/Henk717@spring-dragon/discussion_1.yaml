        html: '<p>As a former Ai dungeon player from 2019 i used to use it A LOT and
          i do have to say i prefered the old model compared to the new ones from
          today. I remember when i first played it and it was just the most amazing
          thing ever. I still remember when they changed the model and the quality
          of the outputs declined and switched a live service. i still decided to
          pay for the service after that but after i heard there was a data leak and
          a few other stuff so i stopped using it and switched to NovelAi when it
          came out which at the time was better than anything Ai Dungeon was doing.
          I will definitely download this model and test this. </p>
