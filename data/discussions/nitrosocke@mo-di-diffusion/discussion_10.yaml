          subject (my prompt being for a blond girl ;) You have to play aorund a lot
          with denoising strength and CFG scale, you need a good resolution input
          picture, adjust the output to the correct aspect ratio and find a good seed,
          many seeds produce crap, always depending on the img</p>
