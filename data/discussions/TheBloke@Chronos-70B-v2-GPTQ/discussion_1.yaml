          <blockquote>

          <p>What will AI be like in the year 1010? Think the solution step by step</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p><strong>In the year 1010, AI would not exist yet since the concept of
          artificial intelligence was first introduced in the mid-20th century.</strong>
          However, if we were to speculate about what AI might be like in such a distant
          future, we could imagine that it may become much more advanced than today''s
          technology.</p>

          <p><strong>By the year 1010, AI systems may have evolved into highly sophisticated
          machines capable of performing tasks autonomously without human intervention.</strong>
          They may even possess consciousness or self-awareness, allowing them to
          make decisions independently based on their own experiences and learning.</p>

          <p>AI may also play an essential role in various aspects of society including
          healthcare, transportation, education, energy production, and manufacturing.
          Robots equipped with intelligent algorithms could carry out dangerous jobs
          or tasks too complicated for humans alone.</p>

          <p>Moreover, AI may help us understand ourselves better through deep analysis
          of data collected over centuries; helping us gain insights into our history
          and possibly predicting how we might shape our destiny going forward.</p>

          <hr>

          <p>The 70B model is able to detect the paradox, but then it follows the
          common mistakes to imagine how adavnaced AI will be like in the near future
          which is a behavior presented in smaller models like 30B and 13B</p>

          <p>Is there any open source model you know that would succeed in such task?</p>
