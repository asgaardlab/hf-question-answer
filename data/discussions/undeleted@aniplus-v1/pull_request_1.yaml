        html: '<p>Since <code>diffusers==0.9.0</code> the width and height is automatically
          inferred from the <code>sample_size</code> attribute of your unet''s config.
          It seems like your diffusion model has the same architecture as Stable Diffusion
          1 which means that when using this model, by default an image size of 512x512
          should be generated. This in turn means the unet''s sample size should be
          <strong>64</strong>. </p>
