        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I have tried to run the original stable diffusion code with this weight,
          but the <code>txt2img.py</code> need to specify <code>--config</code> otherwise
          it will throw an error. I tried <code>sd_finetune_256.yaml</code> in the
          repository but the result was a mess.  Is there anyone know how to set the
          <code>--config</code> parameters? </p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
