        html: '<p>Since this is technically just wizardLM trained on the falcon dataset,
          can it be made into an superhot model with 8k context? Like how you made
          the WizardLM-33B-V1-0-Uncensored-SuperHOT-8K-GPTQ model. If its possible
          it would be greatly appreciated. I''ve been waiting for a larger quantized
          model in 8k as a free competitor to gpt 3.5. </p>
