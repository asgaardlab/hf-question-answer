          <p>Nice, I found your model off one of those sites trying to keep a backup
          in case, things, happen... and just discovered that you are the creator,
          I assume anyway haha.</p>

          <p>So I''ve been using person1, and you''re saying that''s not the functional
          one, haha.  The way they were labelled, I assumed one was for characters
          and the other landscape :P I''ll have to go back and experiment then with
          v1.1.</p>

          <p>I have had AMAZING although inconsistent results with v1.0.  I merged
          with an Anime model as a yolo to see what would happen and it was impressive.  While
          anime isn''t exactly my style for art, I LOVE the final fantasy style.  Let''s
          see if hugging face will let me upload today. AND I think it will, they
          are somewhat cherry picked, and the results without the anime are fantastic,
          but felt compelled to try this cuz of anime friend.</p>

          <p>Man I should have done same prompt with and without the anime part to
          compare.  I dunno there''s just something about the color vibrancy and detail
          quality that appeals to me when the two are mixed.</p>
