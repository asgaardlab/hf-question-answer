        html: '<p>Thank you for releasing this great model.<br>I have one question.</p>

          <p>The "Training" section says that "The model was trained on around 312.5B
          tokens from Japanese CC-100, Japanese C4, and Japanese Wikipedia.." .<br>I
          think the total number of tokens in these corpora is about 180B, and so
          this statement means the training epoch is 1.73 epochs (= 312.5 / 180)?
