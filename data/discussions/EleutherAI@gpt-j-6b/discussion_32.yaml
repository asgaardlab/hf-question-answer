        html: '<p>Hello all,</p>

          <p>Could anyone please share how to get sentence embeddings specifically
          from EleutherAI/gpt-j-6b?<br>I have seen that there are various ways to
          get the sentence embeddings from the AutoModelForCausalLM class, the AutoModel
          class, and the SentenceTransformer class. But the embeddings generated don''t
          match each other. </p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!</p>
