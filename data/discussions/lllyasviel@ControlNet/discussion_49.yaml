        html: '<p>Hello guys,<br>I''ve successfully installed controlnet and its models,
          but none is working (except Soft edge, Scribble, T2IA). I''m usind default
          settings for all the models and I get 2 different errors. I grouped the
          error as follow:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Canny, Depth, Normal, Openpose, MLSD, Lineart, Seg, Shuffle,Tile, IP2P:
          RuntimeError: Placeholder storage has not been allocated on MPS device!</li>

          <li>Reference, Inpaint: ValueError: ControlNet failed to use VAE. Please
          try to add <code>--no-half-vae</code>, <code>--no-half</code> and remove
          <code>--precision full</code> in launch cmd.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Do you have any idea how to fix this issue?</p>
