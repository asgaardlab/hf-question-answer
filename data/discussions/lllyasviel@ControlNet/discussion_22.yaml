        html: '<p>Some people, like me, are using pre-posed PowerPose skeleton images
          to create their img2img illustrations with ControlNet.</p>

          <p>Now, if someone creates a 3d model stick figure (that is color coded
          to be understood by OpenPose) like this one (but with more bones):<br><a

          <p>it would be very helpful to have a better skeleton for the OpenPose model
          (so that includes bones for fingers and feet). At that point, the pre-processor
          wouldn''t need to do any work either, and the generated images could have
          superior poses.</p>

          <p>So, could you please implement a better skeleton for using this technique?
          Thanks a lot :)</p>
