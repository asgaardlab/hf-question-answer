        html: '<p>Hi,<br>I''m using ControlNet depth_leres preprocessor and depth
          model to generate depth masks of images for a project I am doing. My problem
          is, the resultant mask generated is not outputted by the generator, and
          is only shown as a temporary inlined image within the ControlNet annotator
          panel. I want to be able to save a full batch of 300+ of these depth map
          frames from a video, so it is too time consuming to load each frame and
          generate and save each annotator result. I''d like to be able to batch save
          each annotator image result as its generated - can anyone help?<br>Best,<br>dvshkbm<br><a
