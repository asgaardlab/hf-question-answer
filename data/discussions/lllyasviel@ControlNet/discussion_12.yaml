        html: '<p>For characters, I see that there are some good advantages for each

          time would probably have much better results.</p>

          <p>For example, combining Depth, Canny, OpenPose and/or Scribble (instead
          of an outline, it would ideally get an image containing simple lines indicating
          visible character bones [edit: for finger bones]) and taking into consideration
          several factors at the same time, ControlNet would considerably improve
          image outputs.</p>

          <p>So, the question is, is it possible to combine these ControlNet models
          ? Thanks :)</p>
