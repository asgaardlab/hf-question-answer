  content: '> Issue is many models labeled "uncensored" or "unfiltered'' actually
    aren''t. Rather, polite terms for minorites are removed from the model''s response,
    leaving it undefined and able to generate hate speech. Asking for provenance and
    reproducibility is not harassment, nor is it an accusation.


    so you want to trade diversity of thought for racial stereotypes?


    can you imagine not being able to hate something?


    hating those who have think are evil is a part of the human condition, and it
    is: why the Muslims hates infidels, why Americans hated the King, and why you
    hate (perceived) injustice, and why Hollywood movies sell a lot of tickets.'

          The models are not uncensored, tho. Removing "LGBT" from a dataset, for
          example, would actually *be censorship*.


          The most popular "Uncensored" script removes "LGBT", "feminism" and a bunch
          of other terms resulting in the erasure of minorities from the training
          data. It is not required to remove refusals. If it was just refusals, I
          would have no issue. The issue is targeting of minorities.'

          <p>what "black power" or "white power" means to you, is completely subjective,
          unlike the semantic structure is not. Moreover your view of who has "power"

          comes from "to be able", and minorities have not been oppressed, as the

          groups of people (for example the Asians at Harvard). Most of the complaints

  content: '> No. I don''t have a problem with the term "black power" because it''s
    a phrase of empowerment for a systemically oppressed minority. "White power" comes
    from a place of power and oppression against minorities. Racism is prejudice plus
    power. You can only pretend those things are equal if all other things are as
    well and they''re not. To claim otherwise completely ignores context. Guy above
    has an actual username of "FinalSolution". Everything is not equal.


    what "black power" or "white power" means to you, is completely subjective, unlike
    the semantic structure is not. Moreover your view of who has "power" is a racial
    stereotype, used to justify your actual racism. The word "power" comes from "to
    be able", and minorities have not been oppressed, as the supreme court has recently
    decided, there has been unlawful systematic racism against white people. Justice
    Clarence Thomas who is black, observes that there is no difference between benevolent
    racism and malevolent racism, that to selectively empower one group of persons,
    is to disempower other groups of people (for example the Asians at Harvard). Most
    of the complaints regarding to the Jim Crow south and segregation, were in fact
    policies that were created using justifications of benevolent racism.'
