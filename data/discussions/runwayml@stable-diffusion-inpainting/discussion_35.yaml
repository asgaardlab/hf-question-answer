          <p>I''m not sure why, but the inpainted section of my photos frequently
          (and sporadically) produce this "noise" in the image. I have tried adjusting
          all the settings to various levels, switching models, vae, and nothing seems
          to fix it. I haven''t been able to find this issue anywhere else. Has anyone
          else had this happen? If so, is there an easy fix I''m missing?</p>
