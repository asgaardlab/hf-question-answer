        html: '<p>As I know, may be it not correct yet. I currently having an issue
          as:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>I want to train some specific style of image ( my custom style ) using
          DreamBooth on stable-diffusion model runwayml/stable-diffusion-v1-5, it
          worked, but the issue here is i want to use this model "stabilityai/stable-diffusion-2-inpainting"
          to train custom styles as stable-diffusion-v1-5. But I could not find the
          way to fine-tune that inpainting model. I have try to merged these models
          for my use case but there was difference in the param shape of text_model
          from inpainting is different from normal stable diffusion model.</li>

          </ul>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6454a564c9c0dcc8c245265e/Iw_z_6elJklttMr47q6uC.png"><img

          <p>Is there any solution to train new styles using inpainting model or is
          there a method to merge these two model for my purpose ?<br>If there is
          anything not clear yet, please feel free to leave a message i will clarify
          that<br>Thank you,</p>
