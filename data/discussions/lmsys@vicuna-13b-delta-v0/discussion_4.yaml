          <p>This is model v1.0, which has been superseded by v1.1. The deltas for
          v1.1 are <a href="https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1">https://huggingface.co/lmsys/vicuna-13b-delta-v1.1</a></p>

          <p>I have made an HF format repo for v1.1, which you can use immediately
          without needing to apply the deltas.  My v1.1 HF repo is here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-13B-1.1-HF">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/vicuna-13B-1.1-HF</a></p>

          <p>So if you''re having problems applying the delta, I''d recommend just
          downloading my HF model. Then you can run that straight away, with no further
          work required.</p>
