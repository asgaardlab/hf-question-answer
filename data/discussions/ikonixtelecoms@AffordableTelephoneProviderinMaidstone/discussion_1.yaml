          <p>VOIP phone systems in Maidstone are a phone service that allows you to
          make calls over the internet rather than over a conventional analogue phone,
          using optical fibres to make the call. These phones are hosted in one or
          more offsite, secure data centres. One can use them with a variety of devices,
          such as smartphones, conventional phones with adapters, computer software,
          or VOIP phones.</p>

          <p>While using these phones, all information and data are stored on the
          cloud. It saves money on maintenance and updates because everything can
          be easily updated in the cloud. As it is a cloud-based technology, employees
          can utilise its features worldwide as long as they have an active internet
          connection. This makes it feasible for organisations with remote employees
          and remote teams. This also gives a small business the chance to expand
          itself globally. If the business is expanding, it is quite easy to upgrade
          your plan, and your new location will have a separate extension with its
          own identity.</p>
