        html: '<p>Looks like a sentence boundary detection error. In a one-pass model
          like this (i.e., the model predicts SBD and punctuation with one pass through
          the Transformer), SBD can have surprising failures.</p>

          <p>Though on news data this model is nearly perfect w.r.t. SBD, I''m aware
          that this model shows a large difference in SBD performance between in-domain
          (i.e., news data) and out-of-domain (conversational, etc.), which is surprising
          given the simplicity of SBD. To account for this, this model was exported
          with a fixed internal SBD threshold of 0.05 ("5%"). This seems to have made
          it much better on informal data, such as the input in question, but still
          there may be some errors.</p>

          <p>I''m working to improve SBD on out-of-domain data and will release a
          new model soon, with an additional capability as well (predicting "merge"
          tokens, e.g., <code>the f b i agent</code> -&gt; <code>The FBI agent.</code>).</p>
