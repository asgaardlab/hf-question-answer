        html: '<p>Hi, I tried to run the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion#-advanced-weight-compression-lower-than-6-bits">pre
          analysis</a> on <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/sdxl-turbo/tree/main">sdxl-turbo</a>
          my Mac Mini M1, but it keeps OOMing (&gt; 18GB). Even if it succeeds, it
          would take 130 hours based on the current progress bar ({1,2,4,6,8 bits}
          * {single, cumu} * 792 candidates * 60seconds/pipe). </p>

          <p>It would be greatly helpful if Turbo''s recipes could be released for
          those trying to do this. Thanks in advance!</p>
