          since the WER is still converging in the plot you shared so i''m trying
          to see how far it can converge before training on some new datasets like
          MGB-2 but in best case the eval WER is not going below 0.5 for me, can you
          please share some more details of training script and hyper-parameters you
          used.<br>Thank you.</p>
