          <p>I''ve tried both diffusers and default A1111 web ui settings and the
          output is always comparable to this from the hosted inference API on the
          front page:</p>

          <p>I never got anything like what you posted with the model but sometimes
          other models gave me results like that when something was not working properly,
          like xformers not working as it should.. please check your settings, looks
          like something is not working on your end. vae is linked in the description</p>
