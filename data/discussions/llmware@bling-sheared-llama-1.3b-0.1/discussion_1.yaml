        html: '<p>Thanks for your feedback.   Yes, this is the expected behavior.   This
          model was not intended for open-context chat-bot interactions.   It is designed
          for closed-context RAG applications in which both a question and a context
          passage are included in the prompt.   </p>

          <p>In your example, since there is no text in the prompt to answer the question
          "Who are you?", the model is responding as trained, e.g., "Not Found."</p>

          <p>If you try another ''hello world'' variant of your prompt, such as ":  My
          name is William.\n What is my name? :", then in most cases, the model should
          respond with "William."    Please feel free to look at this test dataset  (/datasets/llmware/rag_instruct_benchmark_tester)
          which will give a good view of sample questions and context passage, on
          which the model was trained.</p>

          <p>Hope that answers your question.    Please let me know if you have any
          other questions or feedback.</p>
