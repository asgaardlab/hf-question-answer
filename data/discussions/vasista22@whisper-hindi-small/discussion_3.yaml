        html: '<p>Since this model has been fine-tuned for 57000 steps on about 3500
          hours of data which is quite substantial, the model must have been biased
          completely towards generating Hindi tokens (which in a way is desired in
          this ASR fine-tuning) and is therefore not doing well on the translation
          task.</p>

          <p>To obtain the English translation of a Hindi audio, you may try the 3
          methods listed below:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Set <code>decoder_prompt_ids to (language="hi", task="translate")</code>
          and use the openai''s original whisper model. The accuracy is quite low
          though, from Hindi-&gt;English.</li>

          <li>Using a speech translation model. There are not many good options though
          for Indian languages.</li>

          <li>Using a cascade system. Example, get the Hindi output from a good Automatic
          Speech Recognition (ASR) model (you could continue using this whisper-hindi-small
          for this). Pass the output of this to a machine translation model. The nllb
          from Facebook (<a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M">https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M</a>)
          is good enough from Hindi to English (has a 20-30% error).  This according
          to me is a better option to get the English translation for a Hindi audio.</li>

          </ol>
