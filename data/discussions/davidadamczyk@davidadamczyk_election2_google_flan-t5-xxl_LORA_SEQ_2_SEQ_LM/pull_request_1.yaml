        raw: 'This pull request aims to enrich the metadata of your model by adding
          [`google/flan-t5-xxl`](https://huggingface.co/google/flan-t5-xxl) as a `base_model`
          field, situated in the `YAML` block of your model''s `README.md`.


          How did we find this information? We extracted this infromation from the
          `adapter_config.json` file of your model.


          **Why add this?** Enhancing your model''s metadata in this way:

          - **Boosts Discoverability** - It becomes straightforward to trace the relationships
          between various models on the Hugging Face Hub.

          - **Highlights Impact** - It showcases the contributions and influences
          different models have within the community.


          For a hands-on example of how such metadata can play a pivotal role in mapping
          model connections, take a look at [librarian-bots/base_model_explorer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/librarian-bots/base_model_explorer).
