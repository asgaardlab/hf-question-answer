          about perseverance whenever something bad happens while always trying to
          guide the story towards a happy ending or redemption arc. This leads to
          very boring writing, and even if you try to shift the tone of it, it will
          still try to make it seem like every action has some sort of darker intention,
          then talk about perseverance or something about life-changing events.</p>

          <p>2.2.1, on the other hand, actually creates something interesting to read,
          and the interactions between characters feel more real. Unlike 2.1, it doesn''t
          explicitly state the nature of the situation but instead shows it through
          dialogue and narration. It doesn''t try to guide the story towards a happy
          ending or redemption arc, and it will accurately create a story based on
          your instructions.</p>
