        html: '<p>AI<br>Based on the information provided, we cannot definitively

          <p>AI<br>I apologize for any confusion in my previous response. Upon further
          analysis, we can conclude that since Sally is faster than Paul and Paul
          is faster than Sam, it follows that Sally must be faster than Sam as well.</p>
