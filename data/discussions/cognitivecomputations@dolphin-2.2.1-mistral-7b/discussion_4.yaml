        html: '<p>Just curious. I found your models there in the first place, at the
          top of the list in several categories. Good job. I am still using 2.1, because
          it works well and I had some added commentary in 2.2 with RAG supplemented
          prompting that I suspect would become a problem.  I don''t feel it was even
          an ''Upgrade'' to 2.1 it felt like a different model for my uses. So, I
          was looking forward to see how they scored at least and haven''t seen them
          posted. Thanks again for your great models.</p>
