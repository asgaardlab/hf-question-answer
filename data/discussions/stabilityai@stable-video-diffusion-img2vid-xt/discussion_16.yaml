        html: '<p>Helllo, </p>

          <p>I appreciate your putting this together. I do have an issue, though.
          I keep getting the OOM error within the Streamlit app. I have the Colab
          Pro plan, and have adjusted the frame rate, but still can''t get anything
          to go through. I did try to adjust the video size, however, I received an
          error, which seemed to indicate that it needed to be the size you have it
          set at, so I adjusted it back. Here is the error:</p>

          <p>OutOfMemoryError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 1.10 GiB (GPU
          0; 15.77 GiB total capacity; 13.03 GiB already allocated; 294.12 MiB free;
          15.09 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is &gt;&gt; allocated
          memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation. See documentation
          for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF</p>
