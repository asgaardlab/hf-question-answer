        html: '<p>Hey, amazing work!</p>

          <p>In some of my experiments, the model seems to predict vectors in certain
          areas, which causes the relatively high (&gt; 0.7) cosine similarity.</p>

          <p>I think this might be due to vector collapse. Maybe it''s worth investigating
          in this direction.</p>
