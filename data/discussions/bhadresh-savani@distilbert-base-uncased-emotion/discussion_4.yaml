        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>This model is interesting, but there is one significant issue: it does
          not have a neutral label. I''m processing a business email dataset - just
          the Subject lines for now - and there are a lot of strings there that do
          not exhibit any emotion, just regular business terms. Yet the model assigns
          them all kinds of emotions.</p>

          <p>Also, simply feeding an empty string to the model makes it assign emotions
          to it.</p>

          <p>I think the model would become much more useful if it also had a neutral
          output that was assigned properly when the text was indeed neutral.</p>

          <p>Cheers!</p>
