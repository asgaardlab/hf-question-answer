          I was wondering if this is meant to make smaller images, which are faster,
          and what the ideal resolution is. On reddit you said "1/2 smaller!" which
          would be 384x384. Also it would make sense to link to your ckpt file in
          the model card or just include it in the file list. Also is there a token
          phrase?</p>
