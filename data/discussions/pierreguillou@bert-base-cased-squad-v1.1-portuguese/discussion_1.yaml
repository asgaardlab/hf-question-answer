          to a different SQuAD in Portuguese (The one in the image below):<br><a rel="nofollow"

          <p>There''s a problem in the hub or in the model description. It  leads
          to a mistakenly usage of the wrong data and in the worse it can produce
          a much worse model (Compared to Pierre''s one).<br>I''ve trained two models,
          one with Pierre''s data and another with the hub data, and the results pretty
          far from each other:</p>

          <p>Pierre''s SQuAD-pt Dataset  -&gt; F1 = 82% and EM = 70 %<br>Hugging Face''s
          SQuAD-pt Dataset -&gt; F1 = 62 % and EM = 51% </p>

          <p>You can check the colab notebook and the models in the links below:<br>Training

          <p>I guess there are two ways of solving this problem:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Remove the pointing of this model to that dataset (SQuAD_v1_pt)</li>

          <li>Add Pierre''s dataset, which is much better than the hub one) into the
          hub</li>
