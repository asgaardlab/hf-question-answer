          <p>Furthermore, in a space-constrained environment, the 70k unused embeddings
          (corresponding to reserved tokens) could be removed from the input/output
          embedding matrices. This would reduce the model size by approximately 570M
          parameters.</p>

          <p>I suggest having such a reduced version as well available on HF.</p>
