          <pre><code>I want to train some specific style of image ( my custom style

          to train custom styles as stable-diffusion-v1-5. But I could not find the
          way to fine-tune that inpainting model. I have try to merged these models
          for my use case but there was difference in the param shape of text_model
          from inpainting is different from normal stable diffusion model.

          <p>So If I get your goal correctly, you want an inpainting file for your
          newly finetuned checkpoint (You sucessfully finetuned checkpoint on style
          you want and want a proper inpainting to go with it)? If that was the case,
          use method I link below to get that.</p>

          <p>To ensure you still see the steps I will paste it here (in the case IF
          original reddit post got deleted or something else, but check the reddit
          post first because it contain more info and further discussions about the
          method)<br>1 Go to Checkpoint Merger in AUTOMATIC1111 webui<br>2 Set model
