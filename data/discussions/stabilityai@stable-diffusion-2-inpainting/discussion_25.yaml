        html: '<p>I don''t think its currently possible, but I figured I''d check.</p>

          <p>In Automatic1111, I was able to pass a "denoising" parameter.  There
          is a "strength" parameter in the Diffusers docs (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.3.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion#diffusers.StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.__call">https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.3.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion#diffusers.StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.__call</a>__),
          but when I use this model, I get an error that "strength" isn''t recognized.</p>

          <p>Simlarly, in Automatic1111, I was able to set "sampler" = "Euler A".  In
          Diffusers: (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.3.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion#diffusers.StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.__call">https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/v0.3.0/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion#diffusers.StableDiffusionInpaintPipeline.__call</a>__),
          it looks like the variable is called "scheduler", but I can''t set it to
          "Euler A".</p>

          <p>Anyone know how to pass "strength"/"denoising" and "sampler"/"scheduler"
          to this model?</p>
