        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>The reason this one has the "AutoTrain Compatible" tag is because it
          has a T5 architecture. AutoTrain supports summarization and translation,
          which can be done with the T5 model.</p>

          <p>However this model doesn''t seem intended for summarization/translation
          but rather to be used in a conversational setup.</p>
