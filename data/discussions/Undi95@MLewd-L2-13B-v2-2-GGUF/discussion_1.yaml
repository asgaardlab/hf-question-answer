        html: '<p>Thanks you for creating this updated version . I really like this
          model, but in previous version (MLewd-L2-13B-v2-1-GGUF) I occasionally got
          looping in the model response.   This one is slightly different because
          at very least is using 43 layers (instead of 41 as it was the case for version
          2.1) , but what is important,  I''m no longer having any problem with looping
          at all.<br>This update works perfectly, thanks for making it and keeping
          this model to be my number 1 choice.  </p>
