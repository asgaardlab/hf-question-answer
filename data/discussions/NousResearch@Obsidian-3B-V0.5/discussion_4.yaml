          <p>The image features a wooden table with three Legos blocks on it. Two
          of the blocks are red, and one is blue. They are placed in a way that makes
          them look like they are standing up against a white wall. This arrangement
          creates an interesting visual effect that adds depth to the scene. The Legos
          are positioned in such a way that they appear to be looking at the camera,
          capturing attention with their vibrant colors and unique design.</p>

          <p>This is convincing and all, but I don''t really want it to offer a judgement
          of the blocks. Has anyone had any success making it obey?</p>
