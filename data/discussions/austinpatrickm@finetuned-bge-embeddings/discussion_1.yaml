        html: '<p>Hello.</p>

          <p>Very cool to see a sentence transformer model. </p>

          <p>What was the data it was trained on and for what tasks?</p>

          <p>I ask because I am looking for some model trained on more data than all_mpnet_v2,
          and for asymmetric retrieval tasks. </p>

          <p>Cheers<br>Ap</p>
