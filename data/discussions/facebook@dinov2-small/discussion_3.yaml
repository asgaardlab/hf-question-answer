        html: '<p>Thank you for the amazing work.<br>While I''m experimenting with
          DinoV2 for an image classification task I came across this, it seems to
          me that the image_size specified in the config.json of this model is 518
          while the image size mentioned in the original repo is 224.</p>

          <p>When I checked the pre-processor like below<br>trfms = AutoImageProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/dinov2-small")<br>the
          crop_size is 224 too.</p>

          <p>Should I rather resize the input images to 224x224 and not 518x518?<br>Is
          there any reason for the difference in the image sizes?</p>
