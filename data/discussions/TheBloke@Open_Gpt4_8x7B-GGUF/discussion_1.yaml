        html: '<p>Author of this model merge mentioned community to tell if its worth
          the name, so here are my (biased) questions and model generated answer.
          First is question about its maturity (most models can''t draw as it would
          need second dimension understanding; most models draw cat diagram though;
          try asking to draw Eiffel tower, every time it will be funny). Second question
          is testing of second order knowledge and abstract question. Third question
          is for understanding the connection between two different information.</p>

          <p>Q1:<br>USER<br>draw a fish in ascii</p>

          <p>AI<br> Here is an ASCII art of a simple fish:</p>

          <pre><code>&gt;&lt;((((''&gt;

          </code></pre>

          <p>This is just a very basic representation of a fish, it''s not meant to
          be realistic. ASCII art can be a fun and creative way to represent images
          using text characters, but keep in mind that it might lack the details of
          traditional image or diagram.</p>

          <p>Q2:<br>USER<br>what is the second largest city to capitol of England</p>

          <p>AI<br> The capital of England is London, which is also the largest city
          in the country. The second largest city in England is Birmingham, with a
          population of around 1.1 million people (2018 estimate). It''s located in
          the West Midlands and is known for its diverse culture, rich history, and
          industrial heritage. Other notable large cities in England include Manchester,
          Leeds, Sheffield, Liverpool, Bradford, Bristol and more. However, Birmingham
          remains as the second largest city by population in England.</p>

          <p>Q3:<br>USER<br>why is that there are two sets of primary colors?</p>

          <p>AI<br>The traditional color theory identifies three primary colors: red,
          blue, and yellow. However, in the context of subtractive color mixing (used
          in painting and printing), cyan, magenta, and yellow can also be considered
          as primary colors. This is because when these colors are combined, they
          produce a neutral or black color. The difference between the two sets of
          primary colors lies in the way they interact with light: additive color
          mixing combines light to create new colors, while subtractive color mixing
          combines pigments or dyes to absorb and reflect certain wavelengths of light.</p>

          <p>In summary, there are indeed two different sets of primary colors, but
          they apply to different contexts and methods of creating and perceiving
          color.</p>
