        html: '<p>This model seems to be closest to Hermes1 and gpt4-x-vicuna-13B
          LLAMA1 models,<br>if they were merged one day. </p>

          <p>Model feels uncensored, but still lacks abilities in good concise detailed
          storytelling.<br>However a good start. As most LLAMA2 models are just horrible
          at it.</p>

          <p>Also unlike gpt4-x-vicuna-13B LLAMA1, this model is not as good at math
          and numbers.</p>

          <p>Unlike both LLAMA1 models previously mentioned, it does not have any
          cultural information like in depth understanding of Lord of the Rings world.</p>

          <p>It also not as good at guiding through story unlike  gpt4-x-vicuna-13B
          LLAMA1 model.</p>

          <p>Overall story generation is short and avoiding  on what''s asked, however
          if questioned it will provide some content that you would expect from a
          good concise story. </p>
