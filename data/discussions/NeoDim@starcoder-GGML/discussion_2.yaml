        html: '<p>can you share how you did it? i am trying to use my custom language
          model to ggml. but i also use a <code>tokenizers.Tokenizer</code> that i
          trained on my corpus.<br>i could get <code>merges.txt</code> and <code>vocab.json</code>,
          but idk how i can convert it to <code>tokenizer.model</code> file, which
          seems like the only format the ggml converter is compatible with.</p>

          <p>thanks!</p>
