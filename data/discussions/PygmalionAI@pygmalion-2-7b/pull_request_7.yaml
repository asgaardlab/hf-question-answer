        html: '<p>Hi PygmalionAI team,</p>

          <p>I''m a big fan of your models (Been trying a few of them to integrate
          into a project I''m working on). But there''s been quite a few rough spots
          and I wanted to see what you thought about including some snippets like
          the one''s in this PR just to give people that first step for using your
          model(s) which might help promote wider use of them.</p>

          <p>If you''re not looking for any kind of changes like this just disregrard
          or close this PR :)</p>
