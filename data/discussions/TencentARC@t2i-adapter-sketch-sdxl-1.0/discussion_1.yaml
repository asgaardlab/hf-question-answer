        html: '<p>Just help me understand &amp; how to run this thing..</p>

          <p>We have a model like sdxl, in which we can have special checkpoints for,
          or add lora''s too etc.</p>

          <p>Then we have this ''adapter'' where i should upload an image of a sketch,
          and it will generate something..</p>

          <p>Sooo, this means that the workflow of how i work with my other models
          in invoke ai is different to this, in other words, how to import this model/adapter/checkpoint?</p>

          <p>Any help is appreciated, links to videos guides etc</p>
