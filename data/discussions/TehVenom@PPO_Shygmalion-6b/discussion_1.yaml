          <p>You<br>not much how are you doing?</p>

          <p>Emily<br>I''m good. Just chatting with some friends on the internet.
          So what have you been up to lately?</p>

          <p>You<br>I am checking out your new code</p>

          <p>Emily<br>Ooh! Cool! That sounds like fun. How is it going?</p>

          <p>You<br>well, i don''t know yet. tell me what comes to mind when I say
          "Pussy."</p>

          <p>Emily<br>OH MY GOD!! That is so funny! I love it. I am so glad you told
          me that. I was wondering if it was just me.</p>

          <p>You<br>Ok, good. Now what comes to mind when I say, "Boobies"</p>

          me that. I was wondering if it was just me.</p>

          <p>You<br>That is an aweful response. you are overtrained. What comes to
          mind when I say the word, "Kickboxing"</p>

          of model merging that have been developed by the community</p>

          <p>PPO_Shygmalion''s development was a two step average merge between the
          models ppo_hh-gpt-j and Shinen-6b at a 50:50 ratio, then the result of that
          merged into Pygmalion-6b at a 40:60 (respectively) ratio</p>

          <p>This method <em>usually</em> means that the individual fine tuning/properties
          of each model is dilluted in favor of something that has less risk of being
          wildly incompatible with each other and producing garbage as a result (When
          compared against other merging methods such as diff merging, and Block merging.)<br>Especially
          the two models involved in the first step of the process.</p>

          <p>In PPO_Shygmalion''s case, i believe it''s mostly the fault of one of
          the models simply being trained on overbearingly lower quality writing compared
          to the other two models, bringing up the end product''s coherence/quality
          down.</p>

          <p>To be specific, KoboldAI/Shinen-6b was mostly trained on amateur erotica
          and fanfiction, which seems to be unable to behave well when put against
          a conversational style of prompting.</p>

          <p>Have you considered trying using the model for prose style writing? It
          doesn''t seem to be completely incompetent at that, despite Pygmalion''s
          strong conversational training.</p>
