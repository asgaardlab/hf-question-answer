        html: '<p>Hi, I have a request. If you can upload a Q8_0 version with LOT
          option (--leave-output-tensor, the highest quality Quantized version) so
          that we can do the<br>./quantize  --allow-requantize model-q8_0-LOT.gguf
          Q4_0 or any other type ourselves without loss of quality (I guess).</p>

          <p>For me, on the one hand, downloading the F16 / F32 .pth version and converting
          to gguf is too big, and, on the other, I want to try out multiple quantized
          versions so that I can test out their speeds and quality WITHOUT downloading
          multiple files large files.</p>

          <p>You can provide the quantize script in readme. Just suggesting. Thanks.</p>
