        html: '<p>Hello, I''m using your pre-trained ResNet50 model on CIFAR-100 dataset.<br>I
          have a directory with 10,000 test images(from the CIFAR-100 test set) in
          .jpg format and to apply the pre-trained model to each image, I''m using
          the following transform:<br>''transform = transforms.Compose([transforms.ToTensor(),<br>                                transforms.Normalize(mean=[0.485,
