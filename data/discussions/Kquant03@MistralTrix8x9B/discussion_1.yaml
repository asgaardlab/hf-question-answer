        html: '<p>yeah man, it''s no big deal, and I really appreciate you making
          a GGUF convert of your model. I don''t have a very high-end system so even
          my own merges are really more for research purposes. Having a model to actually
          inference with is really nice :)</p>

          <p>your model turned out well, too...so just continue with confidence and
          try to research whatever interests and inspires you most.</p>
