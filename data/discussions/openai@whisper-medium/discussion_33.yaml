        html: '<p>Hello, I''m currently trying to fine tune whisper medium on 10 hours
          of audio in Swahili. Whenever I fine tune, after about an epoch the model
          starts predicting nothing besides &lt;|endoftext|&gt; tokens. I tried fine
          tuning whisper large-v3 and whisper small without any problem. The only
          difference is the base model I''m using and the processor I am using.</p>

          <p>Does anyone have any idea why this is happening?</p>
