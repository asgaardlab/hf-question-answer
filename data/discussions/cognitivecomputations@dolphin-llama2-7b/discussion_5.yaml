        html: '<p>I know this little one might not bring home all that many awards,
          but it just might be my favorite in this size group.<br>I made a minimal
          test character with it, half of the time she doesn''t know what is she''s
          talking about, but would still come out cute and charming despite being
          wrong.</p>

          <p>She was very much against any kind of genocide, would refuse to help
          with any form of ethnic cleansing, but she would have no problem helping
          with any other kind of "chemistry projects". Perfectly balanced.</p>

          <p>Dolphin dataset has potential. Maybe performance could be boosted a little
          bit by merging some of the prompts in datasets to have more longer examples,
          closer to max 4k tokens. Either case, thanks for all the great work.</p>
