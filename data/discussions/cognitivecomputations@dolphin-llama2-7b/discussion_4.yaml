        html: '<p>Hey there!</p>

          <p>First of, amazing work and contribution to the community, thanks a lot.</p>

          <p>I''ve been trying this model and some of your other ones (WizardLM primarily)
          and have found that multi-turn conversations tend to work fairly well until
          a certain point in the conversation where the model seems to be repeating
          mostly the same stuff over and over again. Looking more closely at the dataset,
          I understand that it doesn''t contain multi-turn data but is rather a set
          of instructions and outputs. Is that correct? If yes, do you eventually
          plan to add support for multi-turn conversations?</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot again!</p>
