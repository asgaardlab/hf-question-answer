        html: '<p>Hi, I''m testing some of the reasoning prompts from the TinyStories
          paper, and I''m getting different, and less coherent generations from this
          model than the results presented in the paper. For example, the paper states
          that the 33M model responds "his grandmother''s house" in response to the
          prompt "On weekends Jack went to visit his grandmother whereas on weekdays
          he would go to school. Last weekend, when Jack was on his way to", but on
          HuggingFace, I''m getting a response of "the library". Any idea on what
          might be happening here that causes this?</p>
