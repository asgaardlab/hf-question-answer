        html: '<p>Thanks for your great work!<br>I have a question regarding the vocabulary.
          Specifically, the paper mentions that "We use GPT-Neo tokenizer but only
          keep the top 10K most common tokens". However, the current uploaded vocabulary
          consists of 50K tokens. Would you please update the vocabulary that can
          be used to reproduce your experiments:)</p>
