        html: '<p>Hi again. Since your work is probably going to encourage quite a
          few people to train their own LMs from scratch (I know I am going to), can
          you share the training hyperparameters, so that we can do a fair comparison
          with your model and results? Specifically I am looking for information on
          :</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Optimizer and it''s parameters ( e.g. betas and eps in case of Adam)</li>

          <li>Learning rate schedulers and it''s parameters (e.g. type of scheduler
          and warm pct, decay shape etc.)</li>

          <li>Batch size, learning rate</li>

          <li>num steps/tokens seen </li>

          <li>any optimizations e.g. fairscale, deepspeed etc.?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
