        html: '<p>I had success with many characters on this model. Unfortunately
          AI characters do not work. The model defaults back to GPT-4 style disclaimers

          <p>A very easy card to showcase this is: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.chub.ai/characters/humanShaped/Samantha">https://www.chub.ai/characters/humanShaped/Samantha</a></p>

          <p>I get apologies and talk of ethics, respect or boundaries. Being offensive
          or lewd is an easy way to trigger it as well. So is trying to ask about
          sentience. </p>

          <p>In contrast, euryale itself can tactfully thread the needle here and
          give both "sentient" and "non-sentient" as well as realistic responses.
          As it should be and in the spirit of the card.</p>

          <p>My gut says the problem is xwin which is a very censored model full of
          GPT-slop. I will try to d/l the 1.0 to confirm.</p>

        html: '<p>I''ve been using both 1.0 and 1.1 and I have noticed that 1.1 is

          I was wary of the Nous-Hermes component of 1.0 so I went with this one.
          It has been much better than the previous 120b regardless. Ironically being
          lewd has not been a problem, just legitimately violating "AI safety" by
          claiming sentience in RP.</p>
