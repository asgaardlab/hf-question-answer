        html: '<p>I am experiencing an issue with the size of the <code>lm_head.weight</code>
          and the <code>model.embed_tokens.weight</code> layers in the model. According
          to the <code>vocab_size</code>, both of these layers should have a size
          of <code>torch.Size([32001, 8192])</code>. However, when I load the checkpoint,
          I observe that these layers have a size of <code>torch.Size([32000, 8192])</code>.</p>

          <p>Has anyone else encountered this issue, or does anyone have any insights
          or suggestions on how to resolve it? Any help would be greatly appreciated!</p>
