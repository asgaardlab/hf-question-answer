        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I''m trying to run the model, however it seems that <code>safe_rlhf.models</code>
          can''t be imported.<br>I''ve tried running <code>pip install safe_rlhf</code>
          as well as installing it directly from the Github link.<br>Note that <code>safe_rlhf</code>
          by itself can import, but doesn''t have a <code>models</code> attribute.</p>

          <p>Is there an updated example code block to run this model?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
