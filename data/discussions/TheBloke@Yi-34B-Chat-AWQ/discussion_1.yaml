          <p>Beyond that, I can''t say.  I don''t know what dataset they used for
          AWQ calibration. I used an English-only dataset, VMware Open Instruct, which
          is a very good English dataset but doesn''t contain any non-English samples.</p>

          <p>My guess is that there''s likely not much difference between them.  They''re
          both AWQ 4-bit 128g, so any difference from the calibration dataset is likely
          to be quite minimal.</p>
