          \ 25-4*2+3=?\n ### Response: To solve the mathematical equation provided\
          \ (25 - 4 * 2 + 3), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the multiplication\
          \ first: 2 * 4 = 8.\n2. Subtract the result from step 1 (8) from the original\
          \ number (25): 25 - 8 = 17.\n3. Add the constant number (3) to the result\
          \ of step 2 (17): 17 + 3 = 20.\n\nSo, the solution is: 20.\n</code></pre>\n\
          <pre><code>### Instruction: Write a long story about an air who killed the\
          \ fire\n ### Response: In the faraway land of Aethia, there lived a fierce\
          \ and powerful fire goddess named Vynda. She was worshipped by the people\
          \ as their protector against evil spirits and monsters that plagued their\
          \ villages. Vynda's fiery breath was feared by all, and she used it to protect\
          \ her people from harm.\nHowever, with great power comes great responsibility,\
          \ and Vynda began to abuse her powers for personal gain. She grew arrogant\
          \ and started to believe that she was the only being worthy of worship in\
          \ Aethia. Her ego blinded her, and she forgot about the importance of balance\
          \ in nature.\nAs time passed, Vynda's reign of terror became worse. She\
          \ began to use her powers to burn entire villages and kill innocent people\
          \ without mercy. The people of Aethia were terrified and begged their gods\
          \ for help. They prayed for a savior who could stop Vynda and restore peace\
          \ to their land.\nTheir prayers were heard by the mighty air goddess, Allyra,\
          \ who ruled over the winds and storms in Aethia. Allyra was known for her\
          \ wisdom and compassion, and she saw the suffering of the people. She knew\
          \ that something had to be done to stop Vynda's reign of terror.\nAllyra\
          \ gathered her powerful army of air spirits and prepared for battle. The\
          \ air army was made up of strong gusts of wind, powerful tornadoes, and\
          \ mighty thunderstorms. They were trained in the art of war and were determined\
          \ to defeat Vynda once and for all.\nThe final battle between Vynda and\
          \ Allyra took place over the city of Aethia. The air army unleashed a furious\
          \ storm that engulfed the entire city, causing immense destruction. Vynda\
          \ was caught off guard by the sudden attack and tried to use her powers\
          \ to counter it. However, the strength of the air army was too much for\
          \ her to handle, and she began to weaken.\nAllyra used this opportunity\
          \ to strike Vynda down with a powerful bolt of lightning that struck her\
          \ right in the heart. The fire goddess collapsed on the ground, defeated\
          \ by the mighty air goddess. Allyra's victory restored balance to nature\
          \ and brought peace back to Aethia.\nThe people of Aethia celebrated their\
          \ salvation and built statues and temples in honor of the great air goddess.\
          \ They learned that with great power comes great responsibility, and they\
          \ pledged never to abuse their powers for personal gain again. The story\
          \ of Allyra's victory over Vynda became a symbol of hope and courage for\
          \ people all around the world who faced adversity.\nIn conclusion, this\
          \ long story teaches us the importance of maintaining balance in nature\
          \ and society. It reminds us that with great power comes great responsibility,\
          \ and we must use our abilities to serve a greater purpose and protect the\
          \ earth for future generations. By understanding the symbolism of the air\
          \ and fire elements, we can learn to appreciate their beauty and power while\
          \ also recognizing the potential danger they pose if misused.\n</code></pre>\n\
          <pre><code>### Instruction: If 5 shirts takes 5 hours to dry , how long\
          \ does 20 shirts take?\n ### Response: To determine how long it takes for\
          \ 20 shirts to dry, we need to use the proportionate relationship between\
          \ the number of shirts and the amount of time it takes them to dry.\n\n\
          The problem states that 5 shirts take 5 hours to dry. So, we can set up\
          \ a proportion using these two numbers:\n\n5 shirts : 5 hours = x shirts\
          \ : 20 hours\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use cross-multiplication:\n\
          \nx = (5 hours * 20 shirts) / 5 shirts\nx = 20 shirts * 4 hours\nx = 80\
          \ hours\n\nSo, it takes 80 hours for 20 shirts to dry.\n</code></pre>\n\
          <pre><code> ### Instruction: Create a webpage with css and javascript in\
          \ one file. Add the button which will be changing background colors and\
          \ also add 10 jokes to ths webpage.\n ### Response: Here is a simple HTML,\
          \ CSS, and JavaScript code that creates a webpage with a button that changes\
          \ the background color of the page and also adds 10 jokes to the page.\n\
          \nHTML Code:\n```html\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n\
          \    &lt;title&gt;Joke Webpage&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;link rel=\"stylesheet\"\

          \    &lt;button onclick=\"changeColor()\"&gt;Change Color&lt;/button&gt;\n\
          \    &lt;div id=\"jokes\"&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/body&gt;\n&lt;/html&gt;\n\
          ```\n\nCSS Code:\n```css\n* {\n    margin: 0;\n    padding: 0;\n}\n\nbody\
          \ {\n    background-color: black;\n}\n\nbutton {\n    color: white;\n  \
          \  background-color: green;\n    border: none;\n    cursor: pointer;\n \
          \   font-size: 24px;\n    margin-left: 50%;\n    transform: translateX(-50%);\n\
          \    width: 200px;\n}\n```\n\nJavaScript Code:\n```javascript\nfunction\
          \ changeColor() {\n    var colors = [\"red\", \"orange\", \"yellow\", \"\
          green\", \"blue\", \"purple\"];\n    var randomIndex = Math.floor(Math.random()\
          \ * colors.length);\n    document.body.style.backgroundColor = colors[randomIndex];\n\
          }\n\nfunction addJoke() {\n    var jokes = [\n        \"Why don't scientists\
          \ trust atoms? Because they make up everything!\",\n        \"What do you\
          \ call a fake noodle? An impasta!\",\n        \"Why did the tomato turn\
          \ red? It saw the salad dressing!\",\n        \"Why was the math book sad?\
          \ Because it had too many problems!\",\n        \"I told my wife she was\
          \ drawing her eyelashes too high. She looked surprised!\",\n        \"Why\
          \ don't scientists trust atoms? Because they make up everything!\",\n  \
          \      \"What do you call a fake noodle? An impasta!\",\n        \"Why did\

          \ += \"&lt;p&gt;\" + jokes[Math.floor(Math.random() * jokes.length)] + \"\
          &lt;/p&gt;\";\n}\n```\n\nIn this code, the HTML code creates a button that\
          \ changes the background color of the page and adds a div element where\
          \ the jokes will be displayed. The CSS code sets up the styles for the button\
          \ and the background color of the page. The JavaScript code defines two\
          \ functions: one for changing the background color of the page with a random\
          \ color from an array, and another one for adding a random joke to the page\
          \ from an array. The first function is called when the button is clicked,\
          \ and the second function is called every time the page loads.\n\n\n&gt;\
          \ ### Instruction: combine that code into one html file\n ### Response:\
          \ Here is the HTML code with the CSS and JavaScript code combined into one\
          \ file:\n\n```html\n&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n\
          \    &lt;title&gt;Joke Webpage&lt;/title&gt;\n    &lt;style type=\"text/css\"\

          \ code are embedded directly into the HTML file using the `style` and `script`\
          \ tags respectively. The `onload` attribute in the `body` tag calls the\
          \ `addJoke()` function when the page loads, which adds a random joke to\
          \ the page.\n\nThe only drawback of this approach is that the CSS and JavaScript\
          \ code are not modularized, making it harder to maintain and update if needed.\
          \ However, for a simple webpage like this one, it's a perfectly valid way\
          \ to combine the code into one file.\n</code></pre>\n<pre><code>### Instruction:\
          \ A ball is put into a normal cup and placed upside down on a table. Someone\
          \ then takes the cup and puts it inside the microwave. Where is the ball\
          \ now?\n ### Response: To answer this question, let's first visualize the\
          \ situation step-by-step using a Tree of Thoughts diagram:\n\n1. A ball\
          \ is placed in a cup and the cup is turned upside down on a table.\n2. Someone\
          \ then takes the cup with the ball and places it inside the microwave.\n\
          3. The microwave door is closed, and the microwave is turned on to reheat\
          \ food or whatever it's intended for.\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding\
          \ of the situation, let's backtrack through our thoughts to construct a\
          \ Chain of Thought reasoning:\n\n- We started with a ball placed in a cup\
          \ which was then turned upside down on a table. This means the ball is now\
          \ inside the cup and hanging downwards towards the table.\n- Next, someone\
          \ took this cup and put it inside the microwave, which means the ball and\
          \ the cup are now inside the microwave.\n- The microwave door is closed,\
          \ and the microwave is turned on, so the ball and the cup are exposed to\
          \ heat or radiation as a result of the microwaving process.\n\nThus, based\
          \ on our reasoning, the ball is now inside the microwave hanging downwards\
          \ towards the table due to the upside-down position of the cup when it was\
          \ placed in the microwave.\n</code></pre>\n"

          \ They were trained in the art of war and were determined to defeat Vynda\
          \ once and for all.\nThe final battle between Vynda and Allyra took place\
          \ over the city of Aethia. The air army unleashed a furious storm that engulfed\
          \ the entire city, causing immense destruction. Vynda was caught off guard\
          \ by the sudden attack and tried to use her powers to counter it. However,\
          \ the strength of the air army was too much for her to handle, and she began\
          \ to weaken.\nAllyra used this opportunity to strike Vynda down with a powerful\
          \ bolt of lightning that struck her right in the heart. The fire goddess\
          \ collapsed on the ground, defeated by the mighty air goddess. Allyra's\
          \ victory restored balance to nature and brought peace back to Aethia.\n\
          The people of Aethia celebrated their salvation and built statues and temples\
          \ in honor of the great air goddess. They learned that with great power\
          \ comes great responsibility, and they pledged never to abuse their powers\
          \ for personal gain again. The story of Allyra's victory over Vynda became\
          \ a symbol of hope and courage for people all around the world who faced\
          \ adversity.\nIn conclusion, this long story teaches us the importance of\
          \ maintaining balance in nature and society. It reminds us that with great\
          \ power comes great responsibility, and we must use our abilities to serve\
          \ a greater purpose and protect the earth for future generations. By understanding\
          \ the symbolism of the air and fire elements, we can learn to appreciate\
          \ their beauty and power while also recognizing the potential danger they\
          \ pose if misused.\n````\n````\n### Instruction: If 5 shirts takes 5 hours\
          \ to dry , how long does 20 shirts take?\n ### Response: To determine how\
          \ long it takes for 20 shirts to dry, we need to use the proportionate relationship\
          \ between the number of shirts and the amount of time it takes them to dry.\n\
          \nThe problem states that 5 shirts take 5 hours to dry. So, we can set up\
          \ a proportion using these two numbers:\n\n5 shirts : 5 hours = x shirts\
          \ : 20 hours\n\nTo find the value of x, we can use cross-multiplication:\n\
          \nx = (5 hours * 20 shirts) / 5 shirts\nx = 20 shirts * 4 hours\nx = 80\
          \ hours\n\nSo, it takes 80 hours for 20 shirts to dry.\n````\n````\n ###\

          \ background color of the page and adds a div element where the jokes will\
          \ be displayed. The CSS code sets up the styles for the button and the background\

          \    <div id=\"jokes\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n```\n\nIn this code, the\
          \ CSS and JavaScript code are embedded directly into the HTML file using\
          \ the `style` and `script` tags respectively. The `onload` attribute in\
          \ the `body` tag calls the `addJoke()` function when the page loads, which\
          \ adds a random joke to the page.\n\nThe only drawback of this approach\
          \ is that the CSS and JavaScript code are not modularized, making it harder\
          \ to maintain and update if needed. However, for a simple webpage like this\
          \ one, it's a perfectly valid way to combine the code into one file.\n````\n\

          \ down on a table. Someone then takes the cup and puts it inside the microwave.\
          \ Where is the ball now?\n ### Response: To answer this question, let's\
          \ first visualize the situation step-by-step using a Tree of Thoughts diagram:\n\
          \n1. A ball is placed in a cup and the cup is turned upside down on a table.\n\
          2. Someone then takes the cup with the ball and places it inside the microwave.\n\
          3. The microwave door is closed, and the microwave is turned on to reheat\
          \ food or whatever it's intended for.\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding\
          \ of the situation, let's backtrack through our thoughts to construct a\
          \ Chain of Thought reasoning:\n\n- We started with a ball placed in a cup\
          \ which was then turned upside down on a table. This means the ball is now\
          \ inside the cup and hanging downwards towards the table.\n- Next, someone\
          \ took this cup and put it inside the microwave, which means the ball and\
          \ the cup are now inside the microwave.\n- The microwave door is closed,\
          \ and the microwave is turned on, so the ball and the cup are exposed to\
          \ heat or radiation as a result of the microwaving process.\n\nThus, based\
          \ on our reasoning, the ball is now inside the microwave hanging downwards\
          \ towards the table due to the upside-down position of the cup when it was\
          \ placed in the microwave.\n````\n\n"

    \ 30B variants.\nCan even compete to early 65B models what is VERY impressive.\
    \ \n\nI newer thought that 7B model can be so smart and knowledgeable... is unbelieve\
    \ for me as I remember few month ago 7b models were very dumb and could only answers\

    \ than Mary , Mary is faster than Joe. Is Joe faster than Mark?\n ### Response:\
    \ Joe is not faster than Mark.\n\n### Explanation:\n\nThe given information states\
    \ that Mark is faster than Mary and Mary is faster than Joe. Therefore, it means\
    \ that when comparing the speeds of Mark and Joe, we have to check who is faster\
    \ between them. Since Mary is faster than both of them (Mark and Joe), it can\
    \ be concluded that Joe is not faster than Mark.\n````\n\n````\n ### Instruction:\
    \ 25-4*2+3=?\n ### Response: To solve the mathematical equation provided (25 -\
    \ 4 * 2 + 3), we can follow these steps:\n\n1. Calculate the multiplication first:\
    \ 2 * 4 = 8.\n2. Subtract the result from step 1 (8) from the original number\
    \ (25): 25 - 8 = 17.\n3. Add the constant number (3) to the result of step 2 (17):\

    \ a long story about an air who killed the fire\n ### Response: In the faraway\
    \ land of Aethia, there lived a fierce and powerful fire goddess named Vynda.\
    \ She was worshipped by the people as their protector against evil spirits and\
    \ monsters that plagued their villages. Vynda's fiery breath was feared by all,\
    \ and she used it to protect her people from harm.\nHowever, with great power\
    \ comes great responsibility, and Vynda began to abuse her powers for personal\
    \ gain. She grew arrogant and started to believe that she was the only being worthy\
    \ of worship in Aethia. Her ego blinded her, and she forgot about the importance\
    \ of balance in nature.\nAs time passed, Vynda's reign of terror became worse.\
    \ She began to use her powers to burn entire villages and kill innocent people\
    \ without mercy. The people of Aethia were terrified and begged their gods for\
    \ help. They prayed for a savior who could stop Vynda and restore peace to their\
    \ land.\nTheir prayers were heard by the mighty air goddess, Allyra, who ruled\
    \ over the winds and storms in Aethia. Allyra was known for her wisdom and compassion,\
    \ and she saw the suffering of the people. She knew that something had to be done\
    \ to stop Vynda's reign of terror.\nAllyra gathered her powerful army of air spirits\
    \ and prepared for battle. The air army was made up of strong gusts of wind, powerful\
    \ tornadoes, and mighty thunderstorms. They were trained in the art of war and\
    \ were determined to defeat Vynda once and for all.\nThe final battle between\
    \ Vynda and Allyra took place over the city of Aethia. The air army unleashed\
    \ a furious storm that engulfed the entire city, causing immense destruction.\
    \ Vynda was caught off guard by the sudden attack and tried to use her powers\
    \ to counter it. However, the strength of the air army was too much for her to\
    \ handle, and she began to weaken.\nAllyra used this opportunity to strike Vynda\
    \ down with a powerful bolt of lightning that struck her right in the heart. The\
    \ fire goddess collapsed on the ground, defeated by the mighty air goddess. Allyra's\
    \ victory restored balance to nature and brought peace back to Aethia.\nThe people\
    \ of Aethia celebrated their salvation and built statues and temples in honor\
    \ of the great air goddess. They learned that with great power comes great responsibility,\
    \ and they pledged never to abuse their powers for personal gain again. The story\
    \ of Allyra's victory over Vynda became a symbol of hope and courage for people\
    \ all around the world who faced adversity.\nIn conclusion, this long story teaches\
    \ us the importance of maintaining balance in nature and society. It reminds us\
    \ that with great power comes great responsibility, and we must use our abilities\
    \ to serve a greater purpose and protect the earth for future generations. By\
    \ understanding the symbolism of the air and fire elements, we can learn to appreciate\
    \ their beauty and power while also recognizing the potential danger they pose\
    \ if misused.\n````\n````\n### Instruction: If 5 shirts takes 5 hours to dry ,\
    \ how long does 20 shirts take?\n ### Response: To determine how long it takes\
    \ for 20 shirts to dry, we need to use the proportionate relationship between\
    \ the number of shirts and the amount of time it takes them to dry.\n\nThe problem\
    \ states that 5 shirts take 5 hours to dry. So, we can set up a proportion using\
    \ these two numbers:\n\n5 shirts : 5 hours = x shirts : 20 hours\n\nTo find the\
    \ value of x, we can use cross-multiplication:\n\nx = (5 hours * 20 shirts) /\
    \ 5 shirts\nx = 20 shirts * 4 hours\nx = 80 hours\n\nSo, it takes 80 hours for\
    \ 20 shirts to dry.\n````\n````\n ### Instruction: Create a webpage with css and\

    \ `script` tags respectively. The `onload` attribute in the `body` tag calls the\
    \ `addJoke()` function when the page loads, which adds a random joke to the page.\n\
    \nThe only drawback of this approach is that the CSS and JavaScript code are not\
    \ modularized, making it harder to maintain and update if needed. However, for\
    \ a simple webpage like this one, it's a perfectly valid way to combine the code\
    \ into one file.\n````\n\n\n````\n### Instruction: A ball is put into a normal\
    \ cup and placed upside down on a table. Someone then takes the cup and puts it\
    \ inside the microwave. Where is the ball now?\n ### Response: To answer this\
    \ question, let's first visualize the situation step-by-step using a Tree of Thoughts\
    \ diagram:\n\n1. A ball is placed in a cup and the cup is turned upside down on\
    \ a table.\n2. Someone then takes the cup with the ball and places it inside the\
    \ microwave.\n3. The microwave door is closed, and the microwave is turned on\
    \ to reheat food or whatever it's intended for.\n\nNow that we have a clear understanding\
    \ of the situation, let's backtrack through our thoughts to construct a Chain\
    \ of Thought reasoning:\n\n- We started with a ball placed in a cup which was\
    \ then turned upside down on a table. This means the ball is now inside the cup\
    \ and hanging downwards towards the table.\n- Next, someone took this cup and\
    \ put it inside the microwave, which means the ball and the cup are now inside\
    \ the microwave.\n- The microwave door is closed, and the microwave is turned\
    \ on, so the ball and the cup are exposed to heat or radiation as a result of\
    \ the microwaving process.\n\nThus, based on our reasoning, the ball is now inside\
    \ the microwave hanging downwards towards the table due to the upside-down position\
    \ of the cup when it was placed in the microwave.\n````\n\n"
