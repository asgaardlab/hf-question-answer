        html: '<p>Does Stability provide any path for startups using this model?</p>

          <p>It feels rather perverse to apply some fine-tuning to a permissively
          licensed 70B parameter base-model, and then post it under a completely non-commercial
          license. These fine-tunes will be obsolete in no-time anyway. At least allow
          startups the opportunity to become bound to a conditional commercial license
          you benefit from down-the-line.</p>
