        html: '<p>This model is impressive, especially given SD''s current limitations.
          My question is this: can I simply replace my current model''s ckpt with
          the PixelartSpritesheet_V.1.ckpt ?</p>

          <p>If so, is that the only step I would have to take to achieve the results
          you''ve produced here?</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
