          here. I''m pretty busy with school but should have an opening coming up
          where I will make some updates. I''ve finally updated the model to open-source.
          Feel free to alter, distribute, display, etc. I would love a mention if
          you do but besides that go wild! </p>

          <p>if you''re a person with any free time and want to help build this concept
          into a fully functioning application for steam let me know! It would be
          cool to get a small group of developers together for some brainstorming.
          I''ve been messing around with the <a rel="nofollow" href="%5Bhttps://github.com/VITA-Group/SinNeRF%5D(https://github.com/sxyu/pixel-nerf)">pixelNeRF</a>
          implementation of NeRF. The goal here is to have the user be able to request
          specific angles/views accomplished by rotating around the NeRF output then
          cleaning it with img2img and repeating (if necessary) until the desired
          angle is arrived at. this is obviously quite slow but for the moment it''s
          just an experiment.</p>
