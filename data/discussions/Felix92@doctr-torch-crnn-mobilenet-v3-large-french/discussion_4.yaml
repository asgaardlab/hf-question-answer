        html: '<p>Hi, I recently came across doctr and it gives in my case a way better
          OCR results that tesseract however it makes "silly" mistakes because it
          doesn''t know polish language. I would like to fine-tune recognition model
          to polish language. I''m wondering how did you solve the problem of dataset
          for french language? Did you generated artificial data? How many samples
          were needed to fine tune the model to french language?</p>

        html: '<p>Hi Tomek :) ,</p>

          <p>mindee has created a internal real dataset of <code>~500k</code> different
          documents (<code>~10M</code> word crops) to train the models from scratch.
          The polish vocabulary is very similar to the french one so it should be
          possible to fine-tune the pretrained models with less data (<code>~10k-20k</code>
          samples).</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Felix</p>
