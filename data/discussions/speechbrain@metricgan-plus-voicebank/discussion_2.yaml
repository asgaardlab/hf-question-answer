        html: '<p>Hi, I am trying to replicate training of MetricGAN+ model exactly
          according to your recipe.<br>The recipe has downloaded vctk data and lexicon
          and then epochs started, about 50 of which passed now.<br>I observe that
          discriminator loss decreases rapidly and then oscilates around 0.05 or so,
          but generator loss oscilates much more without any observable trend to decrease.
          And other metrics (SI-SNR, pesq, stoi) oscilate accordingly.<br>Is this
          expected behaviour for first 50 epochs? Is generator loss starts to decrease
          more noticeable on later epochs?<br>Do you have your training logs to compare
          with?</p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Maxim</p>
