        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I''m relatively new to using LLMs and I''m facing an issue with controlling
          the generation length. Specifically, when I input commands like "Print all
          primes between 1 and n", the model continues generating output until it
          reaches the maximum length limit. I attempted to use the eos_token_id=tokenizer.eos_token_id
          parameter to signal the end of the sequence, but it hasn''t resolved the
          issue. Could someone guide me on how to make the model stop generating once
          it reaches a logical conclusion, instead of continuing until the max_length?</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance for your assistance!</p>
