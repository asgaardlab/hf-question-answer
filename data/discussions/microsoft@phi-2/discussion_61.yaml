          <li>So I closed down the chat again in suspicion of fault, and this time
          it''s depressed and sad. It thinks that it lost it''s mother and tells a

          this is expected but I''ve tested lots of LLMs and never encountered such

    We haven''t observed that behavior yet, even with a base model. Nevertheless,
    we will re-visit the data and try to narrow the issue.
