          <p>I succeeded in installing the Dolphin phi2 model, but still seem to get

          <p>I have been experimenting with the model.generate() max_length parameter,

          the more hallucination, regardless of which phi-2 I use. As I am a total
          beginnger, I have started thinking that does my context window size or context
          memory (where-ever these come from)  affect my response quality or should
          I try to find a fine tuned model (I surely don''t know how to do this myself)
          that gives longer answers suiting my purposes better; If the "default" of
          these phi-2 models is a chat-like response? Or is this a performance issue,
          that my local computing capacity just can''t produce longer responses...</p>

          <p>Anyhow, it is evident that the problem arises from my poor skills and
          not from the phi-2 models. I just find the information about developing
          scripts with phi-2 a bit sharded and difficult to find. Are there any resources
          or tutorials that could be recommended for building a solid ground knowledge
          for playing with Phi-2 and then I could maybe learn more easily from documentations
          and HuggingFaces resources?</p>

    I have been experimenting with the model.generate() max_length parameter, which
    sure affects the amount of hallucination, as longer the return string, the more
    hallucination, regardless of which phi-2 I use. As I am a total beginnger, I have
    started thinking that does my context window size or context memory (where-ever
    these come from)  affect my response quality or should I try to find a fine tuned
    model (I surely don''t know how to do this myself) that gives longer answers suiting
    my purposes better; If the "default" of these phi-2 models is a chat-like response?
    Or is this a performance issue, that my local computing capacity just can''t produce
    longer responses...


    Anyhow, it is evident that the problem arises from my poor skills and not from
    the phi-2 models. I just find the information about developing scripts with phi-2
    a bit sharded and difficult to find. Are there any resources or tutorials that
    could be recommended for building a solid ground knowledge for playing with Phi-2
    and then I could maybe learn more easily from documentations and HuggingFaces
    resources?'

  content: "I tried myself on google colab and works just fine.\n\nHowever, as expected,\
    \ the results arent great, not surprising as it's a quite small model after all.\
    \ \n\nNote that your instruction is very hard for a LLM to follow, as you are\
    \ asking it to count paragraphs, but LLM's are very bad at this. You also ask\
    \ very precise things that LLM's small and generalised like this one cannot follow\
    \ properly. Even good models like Mixtral will have a hard time counting sentences\
    \ and paragraphs.\n\nNevetherless, I figured what was making the model answer\
    \ so weirdly was ur last instructions, if you remove them or simplify it you can\
