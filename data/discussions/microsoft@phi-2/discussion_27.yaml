          <p>Bruh, the term "distribution" can be subjective. One could argue that

        html: '<p>Hi Microsoft Team - We did not receive a direct response, but do
          understand that it may be difficult to provide any kind of blanket ''pre-approval''.   We
          have posted two fine-tuned models in HuggingFace repositories, which include
          full disclosure and links of the Microsoft Research license, as well as
          <strong>bolded</strong> instruction that the model is available for research
          purposes only.   We have also benchmarked our fine-tuned Phi-2 and Phi-1.5
          against other leading small base foundation BLING series models - which
          is the primary reason that we have decided to share the results - we believe
          it is important insights to share with the wider open source community on
          the relative performance of smaller fine-tuned models for RAG use cases.   The
          two model cards can be found at:   llmware/bling-phi-2-v0 and llmware/bling-phi-1_5-v0.      If
          you have any concerns, feedback or input, please contact us anytime- and
          we will immediately take any corrective actions as you recommend.   We always
          aspire to be good collaborators, and we are genuinely trying to play by
          the rules.  :)  kind regards - Darren</p>
