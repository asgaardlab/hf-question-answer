        html: '<p>Hi! I''m in a class, and I''m trying to help my professor figure
          this out. We''ve gotten ModelScope working, along with the ZeroScope that
          allows for it to make 576px width videos. He''s wanting to get us to then
          use ZeroScope XL to refine the video to be 1024, but we''re running into
          this error. Does anyone have any ideas?</p>
