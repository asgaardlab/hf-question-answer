        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I have duplicated the space for the base text to video model here on
          hugging space to speed up rendering but curious as to what would be involved
          in posting the upscaler as a space? Sorry if this seems like an amateur
          question I''m fairly new to hugging face but excited about these creative
          tools!</p>
