          <p>However if you ever run into a prompt that it does not want to do just
          say for an example and it''ll do it. It just needs more testing. Also as
          far as I know ooba does not inject anything. This training was done without
          eval. I also noticed on the first checkpoint it already somewhat leaned
          instruct. Basically just 2 hours and 30min the Lora was somewhat functional.</p>
