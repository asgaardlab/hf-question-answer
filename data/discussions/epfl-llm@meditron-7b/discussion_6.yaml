        html: "<p>I was playing with meditron7b as a means to automatically generate\
          \ QA pairs around maternal health.<br>I have been exclusively testing the\
          \ model through HF transformers package, loading the model in as torch.float16\
          \ on a 4090 gpu.</p>\n<p>The model performs quite poorly in this generative\
          \ task. I am immediately left wondering if this is an issue of the model\
          \ not being properly implemented to interact with HF arguments, if the context\
          \ window for this model is ridiculously small despite the original LLama2\

          \ input (not template or parsed in any way, just raw input to seed the generation):</p>\n\
          <pre><code>Question:\n    What does a doula do?\n    Answer:\n    Most doula-client\
          \ relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. During this period,\
          \ they develop a relationship in which the mother feels free to ask questions,\
          \ express her fears and concerns, and take an active role in creating a\
          \ birth plan. Doulas may provide information about perineal massage and\
          \ other techniques that can help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced\
          \ during childbirth. Most doulas make themselves available to the mother\
          \ by phone in order to respond to her questions or address any concerns\
          \ that might arise during the course of the pregnancy. Understand they do\
          \ not provide any type of medical care. However, they are knowledgeable\
          \ about many medical aspects of labor and delivery. As such, they can help\
          \ their clients gain a better understanding of the procedures and possible\
          \ complications in late pregnancy or delivery. During delivery, doulas are\
          \ in constant and close proximity to the mother. They have the ability to\
          \ provide comfort with pain-relief techniques including breathing techniques,\
          \ relaxation techniques, massage, and laboring positions. Doulas also encourage\
          \ participation from the partner and offer reassurance. A doula acts as\
          \ an advocate for the mother, encouraging and helping her fulfill specific\
          \ desires she might have for her birth. The goal of a doula is to help the\
          \ mother experience a positive and safe birth, whether an unmedicated birth\
          \ or a cesarean. After birth, many labor doulas will help new mothers begin\
          \ the breastfeeding process and encouraging bonding between the new baby\
          \ and other family members.\n     \n    Question:\n    What are the benefits\
          \ of having a doula?\n    Answer:\n    Numerous studies have documented\
          \ the benefits of having a doula present during labor. A recent Cochrane\
          \ Review, Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth, showed a very\
          \ high number of positive birth outcomes when a doula was present. With\
          \ their support, women were less likely to have pain-relief medications\
          \ administered and less likely to have a cesarean birth. Women also reported\
          \ having a more positive childbirth experience.1 Other studies have shown\
          \ that having a doula as a member of the birth team decreases the overall\
          \ cesarean rate by 50%, the length of labor by 25%, the use of oxytocin\
          \ by 40%, and requests for an epidural by 60%.2 Doulas often use the power\
          \ of touch and massage to reduce stress and anxiety during labor. According\
          \ to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell, massage helps stimulate\
          \ the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary gland secretes natural\
          \ oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions) and to the\
          \ brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness, along with\
          \ a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that intravenous\
          \ oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain in substantial\
          \ amounts and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological benefits\
          \ as natural oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that oxytocin\
          \ administered nasally and/or intravenously may cross from the bloodstream\
          \ into the brain. Nonetheless, doulas can help mothers experience the benefits\
          \ of oxytocin naturally without the use of medication.\n    Question:\n\

          \    What are the risks of having a doula?\n    Answer:\n    There are no\
          \ known risks to having a doula present during labor. Doulas are not allowed\
          \ to perform any medical procedures, so there is no risk of infection. Doulas\
          \ are not allowed to administer any medications, so there is no risk of\
          \ overdose.\n    Question:\n    What are the costs of having a doula?\n\
          \    Answer:\n    The cost of a doula varies widely. Some doulas charge\
          \ by the hour, while others charge a flat fee. Some doulas charge a fee\
          \ for prenatal visits, and some do not. Some doulas charge a fee for postpartum\
          \ visits, and some do not. Some doulas charge a fee for travel, and some\
          \ do not. Some doulas charge a fee for phone calls, and some do not. Some\
          \ doulas charge a fee for attending a birth, and some do not. Some doulas\
          \ charge a fee for attending a birth and postpartum visit, and some do not.\

          \ doula do?\n    Answer:\n    Most doula-client relationships begin a few\
          \ months before the baby is due. During this period, they develop a relationship\
          \ in which the mother feels free to ask questions, express her fears and\
          \ concerns, and take an active role in creating a birth plan. Doulas may\
          \ provide information about perineal massage and other techniques that can\
          \ help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced during childbirth.\
          \ Most doulas make themselves available to the mother by phone in order\
          \ to respond to her questions or address any concerns that might arise during\
          \ the course of the pregnancy. Understand they do not provide any type of\
          \ medical care. However, they are knowledgeable about many medical aspects\
          \ of labor and delivery. As such, they can help their clients gain a better\
          \ understanding of the procedures and possible complications in late pregnancy\
          \ or delivery. During delivery, doulas are in constant and close proximity\
          \ to the mother. They have the ability to provide comfort with pain-relief\
          \ techniques including breathing techniques, relaxation techniques, massage,\
          \ and laboring positions. Doulas also encourage participation from the partner\
          \ and offer reassurance. A doula acts as an advocate for the mother, encouraging\
          \ and helping her fulfill specific desires she might have for her birth.\
          \ The goal of a doula is to help the mother experience a positive and safe\
          \ birth, whether an unmedicated birth or a cesarean. After birth, many labor\
          \ doulas will help new mothers begin the breastfeeding process and encouraging\
          \ bonding between the new baby and other family members.\n     \n    Question:\n\
          \    What are the benefits of having a doula?\n    Answer:\n    Numerous\
          \ studies have documented the benefits of having a doula present during\
          \ labor. A recent Cochrane Review, Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth,\
          \ showed a very high number of positive birth outcomes when a doula was\
          \ present. With their support, women were less likely to have pain-relief\
          \ medications administered and less likely to have a cesarean birth. Women\
          \ also reported having a more positive childbirth experience.1 Other studies\
          \ have shown that having a doula as a member of the birth team decreases\
          \ the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the length of labor by 25%, the use\
          \ of oxytocin by 40%, and requests for an epidural by 60%.2 Doulas often\
          \ use the power of touch and massage to reduce stress and anxiety during\
          \ labor. According to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell, massage\
          \ helps stimulate the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary gland\
          \ secretes natural oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions)\
          \ and to the brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness,\
          \ along with a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that\
          \ intravenous oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain\
          \ in substantial amounts and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological\
          \ benefits as natural oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that\
          \ oxytocin administered nasally and/or intravenously may cross from the\
          \ bloodstream into the brain. Nonetheless, doulas can help mothers experience\
          \ the benefits of oxytocin naturally without the use of medication.\n  \
          \  Question:\n    Do doulas offer any specific techniques to reduce pain?\n\
          \    Answer:\n    Doulas often use aromatherapy and other techniques to\
          \ help ease labor pains. Some doulas teach breathing techniques and massage\
          \ as part of their birth preparation and labor support services. Many doulas\
          \ use aromatherapy techniques to help reduce pain. During labor, doulas\
          \ use scents such as lavender, rose, jasmine, or ylang ylang to induce more\
          \ positive feelings. During the first stage of labor, the scents may be\
          \ massaged onto the abdomen, back, or feet to help reduce stress. In the\
          \ second stage, aromatherapy may be offered to mothers in labor by placing\
          \ a few drops of scent onto a handkerchief and allowing the drops to absorb\
          \ into the vapors in the air. Doulas often keep aromatherapy products close\
          \ at hand and ask the mother whether any of these scents appeal to her.\n\
          \     \n    Question:\n    What else?\n    Answer:\n    Doulas can help\
          \ a mother relax her body, allowing her body to take over the work of birth\
          \ itself. As a labor progresses, doulas work to help the birth take place\
          \ in an environment that is low-light, low-noise, and clean. Doulas may\
          \ also help a mother to choose a position to promote labor. For example,\
          \ doulas often encourage mothers to choose birth positions that will promote\
          \ upright labor. Upright positions help to promote circulation and oxygen\
          \ to the baby\u2019s brain, promoting better birth outcomes. These positions\
          \ can include kneeling on the floor or standing with support. Doulas may\
          \ also help to prepare the mother for labor by helping her to practice laboring\
          \ positions at home or in the community.\n     \n    Question:\n    Is there\
          \ any cost associated with doula services?\n    Answer:\n    At the time\
          \ of publication of this article, most doula services are donated or offered\
          \ at a small fraction of the costs of other forms of birth support, such\
          \ as birthing center services or a hospital support person. Cost to the\
          \ mother is usually covered by the childbirth educator or other birth professional\
          \ who refers the mother to the doula. In some cases, doula services involve\
          \ a small fee to the mother. Questions about cost are important to ask during\
          \ the process of selecting a doula to ensure cost does not interfere with\
          \ the doula\u2019s ability to provide emotional and informational support\
          \ during labor.\n    The most important thing for the birth professional\
          \ or childbirth educator to convey to expectant parents is that whatever\
          \ costs are encountered during labor and delivery can be amortized into\
          \ the price of the birth experience over a number of years. For example,\
          \ many birthing-center clients find that the cost of a midwife\u2019s services\
          \ over a number of years is less than the price of routine prenatal care\
          \ over the same amount of time. And, for couples who prefer out-of-hospital\
          \ births, the cost of the services of an individual birth professional,\
          \ such as a doula, may well be spread out over several years.\n     \n \
          \   Question:\n    What should I look for in a doula?\n    Answer:\n   \
          \ Choosing a doula is similar to choosing any other birth support person\
          \ or professional. While doulas are not required for a safe birth, they\
          \ are highly recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists\
          \ (ACOG) states that \u201Cduring the period of labor, pregnant women may\
          \ benefit from continuous emotional support of a doula.\u201D3 The American\
          \ College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) states, \u201Cthe doula may be provided\
          \ by the health care provider, a consumer advocacy group, or by other sources,\
          \ but remains an individual, paid person.\u201D4 The National Perinatal\
          \ Association supports the role of the individual doula as part of the birth\
          \ team.5,6 Doulas are generally independent contractors, not employees.\
          \ An essential part of birth support is the formation of trust between a\
          \ woman and her doula. The doula must be someone who understands and believes\
          \ in birth and who has no competing agendas or interests (other than the\
          \ baby\u2019s) during the birth.\n    Question:\n    Should a doula be someone\
          \ I know?\n    Answer:\n    Anyone who is passionate about birth and knows\
          \ about doula services may be recommended by someone as a candidate for\
          \ a doula. Many doulas begin as labor support partners or birth assistants\
          \ for friends and family. Including their own family members during birth\
          \ preparation helps the doula to understand the needs of the birthing family.\
          \ Once they have had a few successful experiences, they may decide to extend\
          \ their labor support to more families. Doulas may also be recruited from\
          \ professional organizations, such as the Birthworks Association (see Resources).\
          \ Doulas who are employed through childbirth educator organizations may\
          \ require that clients become their childbirth class participants first.\
          \ Some doulas may also be certified and have received training to perform\
          \ other health-care-related functions, such as midwifery and massage. Whether\
          \ a doula is recommended by a family member or not, it is important that\
          \ the support person be someone who can understand and share the birthing\
          \ family\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and beliefs on the birth process. It\
          \ is important to discuss the relationship that the doula will have with\
          \ other members of the birth team, including the midwife, obstetrician,\
          \ and other caregivers, such as the birth partner or nurse.\n    Question:\n\
          \    What should I look for in a doula?\n    Answer:\n    Choosing a doula\
          \ is similar to choosing any other birth support person or professional.\
          \ While doulas are not required for a safe birth, they are highly recommended.\
          \ The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states\
          \ that \u201Cduring the period of labor, pregnant women may benefit from\
          \ continuous emotional support of a doula.\u201D3 The American College of\

          \   Most doula-client relationships begin a few months before the baby is\
          \ due. During this period, they develop a relationship in which the mother\
          \ feels free to ask questions, express her fears and concerns, and take\
          \ an active role in creating a birth plan. Doulas may provide information\
          \ about perineal massage and other techniques that can help to reduce stress\
          \ and trauma often experienced during childbirth. Most doulas make themselves\
          \ available to the mother by phone in order to respond to her questions\
          \ or address any concerns that might arise during the course of the pregnancy.\
          \ Understand they do not provide any type of medical care. However, they\
          \ are knowledgeable about many medical aspects of labor and delivery. As\
          \ such, they can help their clients gain a better understanding of the procedures\
          \ and possible complications in late pregnancy or delivery. During delivery,\
          \ doulas are in constant and close proximity to the mother. They have the\
          \ ability to provide comfort with pain-relief techniques including breathing\
          \ techniques, relaxation techniques, massage, and laboring positions. Doulas\
          \ also encourage participation from the partner and offer reassurance. A\
          \ doula acts as an advocate for the mother, encouraging and helping her\
          \ fulfill specific desires she might have for her birth. The goal of a doula\
          \ is to help the mother experience a positive and safe birth, whether an\
          \ unmedicated birth or a cesarean. After birth, many labor doulas will help\
          \ new mothers begin the breastfeeding process and encouraging bonding between\
          \ the new baby and other family members.\r\n     \r\n    Question:\r\n \
          \   What are the benefits of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Numerous\
          \ studies have documented the benefits of having a doula present during\
          \ labor. A recent Cochrane Review, Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth,\
          \ showed a very high number of positive birth outcomes when a doula was\
          \ present. With their support, women were less likely to have pain-relief\
          \ medications administered and less likely to have a cesarean birth. Women\
          \ also reported having a more positive childbirth experience.1 Other studies\
          \ have shown that having a doula as a member of the birth team decreases\
          \ the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the length of labor by 25%, the use\
          \ of oxytocin by 40%, and requests for an epidural by 60%.2 Doulas often\
          \ use the power of touch and massage to reduce stress and anxiety during\
          \ labor. According to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell, massage\
          \ helps stimulate the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary gland\
          \ secretes natural oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions)\
          \ and to the brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness,\
          \ along with a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that\
          \ intravenous oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain\
          \ in substantial amounts and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological\
          \ benefits as natural oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that\
          \ oxytocin administered nasally and/or intravenously may cross from the\
          \ bloodstream into the brain. Nonetheless, doulas can help mothers experience\
          \ the benefits of oxytocin naturally without the use of medication.\r\n\

          \n    What are the risks of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    There\
          \ are no known risks to having a doula present during labor. Doulas are\
          \ not allowed to perform any medical procedures, so there is no risk of\
          \ infection. Doulas are not allowed to administer any medications, so there\
          \ is no risk of overdose.\r\n    Question:\r\n    What are the costs of\
          \ having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    The cost of a doula varies widely.\
          \ Some doulas charge by the hour, while others charge a flat fee. Some doulas\
          \ charge a fee for prenatal visits, and some do not. Some doulas charge\

          \ 1.1 and keep everything else the same.\r\n```\r\nQuestion:\r\n    How\
          \ much training does a doula receive?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    There are no\
          \ formal requirements for becoming a doula; however, most doulas complete\
          \ a training program. Training programs vary widely in content, duration,\
          \ and cost. Some programs are offered online while others require attendance\
          \ at workshops. Many doulas choose to become certified through one of several\
          \ organizations, such as DONA International (Doulas of North America), Birthworks,\
          \ or the Association of Labor Assisting Midwives (ALAM). These organizations\
          \ offer different levels of certification based on the amount of training\
          \ completed. In addition to completing a training program, doulas must be\
          \ able to demonstrate competency in providing emotional support and physical\
          \ assistance during labor.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Do I need to hire my\
          \ own doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    It depends. If you are planning to give\
          \ birth in a hospital setting, then it is highly recommended that you hire\
          \ your own doula. Hospitals typically only allow one support person to be\
          \ present during labor and delivery. This person cannot be a nurse, doctor,\
          \ midwife, or other healthcare provider. Therefore, if you want someone\
          \ who is familiar with the birthing process and who can assist you during\
          \ labor, then you should consider hiring a doula.\r\n    Question:\r\n \
          \   Can I find a doula through my insurance company?\r\n    Answer:\r\n\
          \    No. Doulas are not covered under any health insurance plans. However,\
          \ some states offer Medicaid coverage for doula services. Check with your\
          \ state\u2019s Medicaid office to see if doula services are covered.\r\n\
          \    Question:\r\n    Are doulas covered by Medicare?\r\n    Answer:\r\n\
          \    No. Doulas are not covered by Medicare.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Can\

          \ care. Doulas are not allowed to perform any invasive procedures such as\

          \ do?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Most doula-client relationships begin a few\
          \ months before the baby is due. During this period, they develop a relationship\
          \ in which the mother feels free to ask questions, express her fears and\
          \ concerns, and take an active role in creating a birth plan. Doulas may\
          \ provide information about perineal massage and other techniques that can\
          \ help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced during childbirth.\
          \ Most doulas make themselves available to the mother by phone in order\
          \ to respond to her questions or address any concerns that might arise during\
          \ the course of the pregnancy. Understand they do not provide any type of\
          \ medical care. However, they are knowledgeable about many medical aspects\
          \ of labor and delivery. As such, they can help their clients gain a better\
          \ understanding of the procedures and possible complications in late pregnancy\
          \ or delivery. During delivery, doulas are in constant and close proximity\
          \ to the mother. They have the ability to provide comfort with pain-relief\
          \ techniques including breathing techniques, relaxation techniques, massage,\
          \ and laboring positions. Doulas also encourage participation from the partner\
          \ and offer reassurance. A doula acts as an advocate for the mother, encouraging\
          \ and helping her fulfill specific desires she might have for her birth.\
          \ The goal of a doula is to help the mother experience a positive and safe\
          \ birth, whether an unmedicated birth or a cesarean. After birth, many labor\
          \ doulas will help new mothers begin the breastfeeding process and encouraging\
          \ bonding between the new baby and other family members.\r\n     \r\n  \
          \  Question:\r\n    What are the benefits of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\
          \n    Numerous studies have documented the benefits of having a doula present\
          \ during labor. A recent Cochrane Review, Continuous Support for Women During\
          \ Childbirth, showed a very high number of positive birth outcomes when\
          \ a doula was present. With their support, women were less likely to have\
          \ pain-relief medications administered and less likely to have a cesarean\
          \ birth. Women also reported having a more positive childbirth experience.1\
          \ Other studies have shown that having a doula as a member of the birth\
          \ team decreases the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the length of labor by\
          \ 25%, the use of oxytocin by 40%, and requests for an epidural by 60%.2\
          \ Doulas often use the power of touch and massage to reduce stress and anxiety\
          \ during labor. According to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell,\
          \ massage helps stimulate the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary\
          \ gland secretes natural oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions)\
          \ and to the brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness,\
          \ along with a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that\
          \ intravenous oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain\
          \ in substantial amounts and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological\
          \ benefits as natural oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that\
          \ oxytocin administered nasally and/or intravenously may cross from the\
          \ bloodstream into the brain. Nonetheless, doulas can help mothers experience\
          \ the benefits of oxytocin naturally without the use of medication.\r\n\
          \    Question:\r\n    Do doulas offer any specific techniques to reduce\
          \ pain?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Doulas often use aromatherapy and other techniques\
          \ to help ease labor pains. Some doulas teach breathing techniques and massage\
          \ as part of their birth preparation and labor support services. Many doulas\
          \ use aromatherapy techniques to help reduce pain. During labor, doulas\
          \ use scents such as lavender, rose, jasmine, or ylang ylang to induce more\
          \ positive feelings. During the first stage of labor, the scents may be\
          \ massaged onto the abdomen, back, or feet to help reduce stress. In the\
          \ second stage, aromatherapy may be offered to mothers in labor by placing\
          \ a few drops of scent onto a handkerchief and allowing the drops to absorb\
          \ into the vapors in the air. Doulas often keep aromatherapy products close\
          \ at hand and ask the mother whether any of these scents appeal to her.\r\
          \n     \r\n    Question:\r\n    What else?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Doulas\
          \ can help a mother relax her body, allowing her body to take over the work\
          \ of birth itself. As a labor progresses, doulas work to help the birth\
          \ take place in an environment that is low-light, low-noise, and clean.\
          \ Doulas may also help a mother to choose a position to promote labor. For\
          \ example, doulas often encourage mothers to choose birth positions that\
          \ will promote upright labor. Upright positions help to promote circulation\
          \ and oxygen to the baby\u2019s brain, promoting better birth outcomes.\
          \ These positions can include kneeling on the floor or standing with support.\
          \ Doulas may also help to prepare the mother for labor by helping her to\
          \ practice laboring positions at home or in the community.\r\n     \r\n\
          \    Question:\r\n    Is there any cost associated with doula services?\r\
          \n    Answer:\r\n    At the time of publication of this article, most doula\
          \ services are donated or offered at a small fraction of the costs of other\
          \ forms of birth support, such as birthing center services or a hospital\
          \ support person. Cost to the mother is usually covered by the childbirth\
          \ educator or other birth professional who refers the mother to the doula.\
          \ In some cases, doula services involve a small fee to the mother. Questions\
          \ about cost are important to ask during the process of selecting a doula\
          \ to ensure cost does not interfere with the doula\u2019s ability to provide\
          \ emotional and informational support during labor.\r\n    The most important\
          \ thing for the birth professional or childbirth educator to convey to expectant\
          \ parents is that whatever costs are encountered during labor and delivery\
          \ can be amortized into the price of the birth experience over a number\
          \ of years. For example, many birthing-center clients find that the cost\
          \ of a midwife\u2019s services over a number of years is less than the price\
          \ of routine prenatal care over the same amount of time. And, for couples\
          \ who prefer out-of-hospital births, the cost of the services of an individual\
          \ birth professional, such as a doula, may well be spread out over several\
          \ years.\r\n     \r\n    Question:\r\n    What should I look for in a doula?\r\
          \n    Answer:\r\n    Choosing a doula is similar to choosing any other birth\
          \ support person or professional. While doulas are not required for a safe\
          \ birth, they are highly recommended. The American College of Obstetricians\
          \ and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that \u201Cduring the period of labor,\
          \ pregnant women may benefit from continuous emotional support of a doula.\u201D\
          3 The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) states, \u201Cthe doula\
          \ may be provided by the health care provider, a consumer advocacy group,\
          \ or by other sources, but remains an individual, paid person.\u201D4 The\
          \ National Perinatal Association supports the role of the individual doula\
          \ as part of the birth team.5,6 Doulas are generally independent contractors,\
          \ not employees. An essential part of birth support is the formation of\
          \ trust between a woman and her doula. The doula must be someone who understands\
          \ and believes in birth and who has no competing agendas or interests (other\
          \ than the baby\u2019s) during the birth.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Should\
          \ a doula be someone I know?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Anyone who is passionate\
          \ about birth and knows about doula services may be recommended by someone\
          \ as a candidate for a doula. Many doulas begin as labor support partners\
          \ or birth assistants for friends and family. Including their own family\
          \ members during birth preparation helps the doula to understand the needs\
          \ of the birthing family. Once they have had a few successful experiences,\
          \ they may decide to extend their labor support to more families. Doulas\
          \ may also be recruited from professional organizations, such as the Birthworks\
          \ Association (see Resources). Doulas who are employed through childbirth\
          \ educator organizations may require that clients become their childbirth\
          \ class participants first. Some doulas may also be certified and have received\
          \ training to perform other health-care-related functions, such as midwifery\
          \ and massage. Whether a doula is recommended by a family member or not,\
          \ it is important that the support person be someone who can understand\
          \ and share the birthing family\u2019s thoughts, feelings, and beliefs on\
          \ the birth process. It is important to discuss the relationship that the\
          \ doula will have with other members of the birth team, including the midwife,\
          \ obstetrician, and other caregivers, such as the birth partner or nurse.\r\
          \n    Question:\r\n    What should I look for in a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\
          \n    Choosing a doula is similar to choosing any other birth support person\
          \ or professional. While doulas are not required for a safe birth, they\

    \n\r\nThe model performs quite poorly in this generative task. I am immediately\

    Question:\r\n    What does a doula do?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Most doula-client\
    \ relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. During this period,\
    \ they develop a relationship in which the mother feels free to ask questions,\
    \ express her fears and concerns, and take an active role in creating a birth\
    \ plan. Doulas may provide information about perineal massage and other techniques\
    \ that can help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced during childbirth.\
    \ Most doulas make themselves available to the mother by phone in order to respond\
    \ to her questions or address any concerns that might arise during the course\
    \ of the pregnancy. Understand they do not provide any type of medical care. However,\
    \ they are knowledgeable about many medical aspects of labor and delivery. As\
    \ such, they can help their clients gain a better understanding of the procedures\
    \ and possible complications in late pregnancy or delivery. During delivery, doulas\
    \ are in constant and close proximity to the mother. They have the ability to\
    \ provide comfort with pain-relief techniques including breathing techniques,\
    \ relaxation techniques, massage, and laboring positions. Doulas also encourage\
    \ participation from the partner and offer reassurance. A doula acts as an advocate\
    \ for the mother, encouraging and helping her fulfill specific desires she might\
    \ have for her birth. The goal of a doula is to help the mother experience a positive\
    \ and safe birth, whether an unmedicated birth or a cesarean. After birth, many\
    \ labor doulas will help new mothers begin the breastfeeding process and encouraging\
    \ bonding between the new baby and other family members.\r\n     \r\n    Question:\r\
    \n    What are the benefits of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Numerous\
    \ studies have documented the benefits of having a doula present during labor.\
    \ A recent Cochrane Review, Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth, showed\
    \ a very high number of positive birth outcomes when a doula was present. With\
    \ their support, women were less likely to have pain-relief medications administered\
    \ and less likely to have a cesarean birth. Women also reported having a more\
    \ positive childbirth experience.1 Other studies have shown that having a doula\
    \ as a member of the birth team decreases the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the\
    \ length of labor by 25%, the use of oxytocin by 40%, and requests for an epidural\
    \ by 60%.2 Doulas often use the power of touch and massage to reduce stress and\
    \ anxiety during labor. According to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell,\
    \ massage helps stimulate the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary gland\
    \ secretes natural oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions)\
    \ and to the brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness, along\
    \ with a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that intravenous\
    \ oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain in substantial amounts\
    \ and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological benefits as natural\
    \ oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that oxytocin administered nasally\
    \ and/or intravenously may cross from the bloodstream into the brain. Nonetheless,\
    \ doulas can help mothers experience the benefits of oxytocin naturally without\
    \ the use of medication.\r\n    Question:\r\n```\r\nAll examples are generated\

    \n    What are the risks of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    There are no\
    \ known risks to having a doula present during labor. Doulas are not allowed to\
    \ perform any medical procedures, so there is no risk of infection. Doulas are\
    \ not allowed to administer any medications, so there is no risk of overdose.\r\

    \n```\r\nQuestion:\r\n    How much training does a doula receive?\r\n    Answer:\r\
    \n    There are no formal requirements for becoming a doula; however, most doulas\
    \ complete a training program. Training programs vary widely in content, duration,\
    \ and cost. Some programs are offered online while others require attendance at\
    \ workshops. Many doulas choose to become certified through one of several organizations,\
    \ such as DONA International (Doulas of North America), Birthworks, or the Association\
    \ of Labor Assisting Midwives (ALAM). These organizations offer different levels\
    \ of certification based on the amount of training completed. In addition to completing\
    \ a training program, doulas must be able to demonstrate competency in providing\
    \ emotional support and physical assistance during labor.\r\n    Question:\r\n\
    \    Do I need to hire my own doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    It depends. If you\
    \ are planning to give birth in a hospital setting, then it is highly recommended\
    \ that you hire your own doula. Hospitals typically only allow one support person\
    \ to be present during labor and delivery. This person cannot be a nurse, doctor,\
    \ midwife, or other healthcare provider. Therefore, if you want someone who is\
    \ familiar with the birthing process and who can assist you during labor, then\
    \ you should consider hiring a doula.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Can I find a doula\
    \ through my insurance company?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    No. Doulas are not covered\
    \ under any health insurance plans. However, some states offer Medicaid coverage\
    \ for doula services. Check with your state\u2019s Medicaid office to see if doula\
    \ services are covered.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Are doulas covered by Medicare?\r\

    ```\r\nQuestion:\r\n    What does a doula do?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Most doula-client\
    \ relationships begin a few months before the baby is due. During this period,\
    \ they develop a relationship in which the mother feels free to ask questions,\
    \ express her fears and concerns, and take an active role in creating a birth\
    \ plan. Doulas may provide information about perineal massage and other techniques\
    \ that can help to reduce stress and trauma often experienced during childbirth.\
    \ Most doulas make themselves available to the mother by phone in order to respond\
    \ to her questions or address any concerns that might arise during the course\
    \ of the pregnancy. Understand they do not provide any type of medical care. However,\
    \ they are knowledgeable about many medical aspects of labor and delivery. As\
    \ such, they can help their clients gain a better understanding of the procedures\
    \ and possible complications in late pregnancy or delivery. During delivery, doulas\
    \ are in constant and close proximity to the mother. They have the ability to\
    \ provide comfort with pain-relief techniques including breathing techniques,\
    \ relaxation techniques, massage, and laboring positions. Doulas also encourage\
    \ participation from the partner and offer reassurance. A doula acts as an advocate\
    \ for the mother, encouraging and helping her fulfill specific desires she might\
    \ have for her birth. The goal of a doula is to help the mother experience a positive\
    \ and safe birth, whether an unmedicated birth or a cesarean. After birth, many\
    \ labor doulas will help new mothers begin the breastfeeding process and encouraging\
    \ bonding between the new baby and other family members.\r\n     \r\n    Question:\r\
    \n    What are the benefits of having a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Numerous\
    \ studies have documented the benefits of having a doula present during labor.\
    \ A recent Cochrane Review, Continuous Support for Women During Childbirth, showed\
    \ a very high number of positive birth outcomes when a doula was present. With\
    \ their support, women were less likely to have pain-relief medications administered\
    \ and less likely to have a cesarean birth. Women also reported having a more\
    \ positive childbirth experience.1 Other studies have shown that having a doula\
    \ as a member of the birth team decreases the overall cesarean rate by 50%, the\
    \ length of labor by 25%, the use of oxytocin by 40%, and requests for an epidural\
    \ by 60%.2 Doulas often use the power of touch and massage to reduce stress and\
    \ anxiety during labor. According to physicians Marshal Klaus and John Kennell,\
    \ massage helps stimulate the production of natural oxytocin. The pituitary gland\
    \ secretes natural oxytocin to the bloodstream (causing uterine contractions)\
    \ and to the brain (resulting in feelings of well-being and drowsiness, along\
    \ with a higher pain threshold). Historically it was thought that intravenous\
    \ oxytocin does not cross from the bloodstream into the brain in substantial amounts\
    \ and, therefore, does not provide the same psychological benefits as natural\
    \ oxytocin. However, more recent studies indicate that oxytocin administered nasally\
    \ and/or intravenously may cross from the bloodstream into the brain. Nonetheless,\
    \ doulas can help mothers experience the benefits of oxytocin naturally without\
    \ the use of medication.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Do doulas offer any specific\
    \ techniques to reduce pain?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Doulas often use aromatherapy\
    \ and other techniques to help ease labor pains. Some doulas teach breathing techniques\
    \ and massage as part of their birth preparation and labor support services. Many\
    \ doulas use aromatherapy techniques to help reduce pain. During labor, doulas\
    \ use scents such as lavender, rose, jasmine, or ylang ylang to induce more positive\
    \ feelings. During the first stage of labor, the scents may be massaged onto the\
    \ abdomen, back, or feet to help reduce stress. In the second stage, aromatherapy\
    \ may be offered to mothers in labor by placing a few drops of scent onto a handkerchief\
    \ and allowing the drops to absorb into the vapors in the air. Doulas often keep\
    \ aromatherapy products close at hand and ask the mother whether any of these\
    \ scents appeal to her.\r\n     \r\n    Question:\r\n    What else?\r\n    Answer:\r\
    \n    Doulas can help a mother relax her body, allowing her body to take over\
    \ the work of birth itself. As a labor progresses, doulas work to help the birth\
    \ take place in an environment that is low-light, low-noise, and clean. Doulas\
    \ may also help a mother to choose a position to promote labor. For example, doulas\
    \ often encourage mothers to choose birth positions that will promote upright\
    \ labor. Upright positions help to promote circulation and oxygen to the baby\u2019\
    s brain, promoting better birth outcomes. These positions can include kneeling\
    \ on the floor or standing with support. Doulas may also help to prepare the mother\
    \ for labor by helping her to practice laboring positions at home or in the community.\r\
    \n     \r\n    Question:\r\n    Is there any cost associated with doula services?\r\
    \n    Answer:\r\n    At the time of publication of this article, most doula services\
    \ are donated or offered at a small fraction of the costs of other forms of birth\
    \ support, such as birthing center services or a hospital support person. Cost\
    \ to the mother is usually covered by the childbirth educator or other birth professional\
    \ who refers the mother to the doula. In some cases, doula services involve a\
    \ small fee to the mother. Questions about cost are important to ask during the\
    \ process of selecting a doula to ensure cost does not interfere with the doula\u2019\
    s ability to provide emotional and informational support during labor.\r\n   \
    \ The most important thing for the birth professional or childbirth educator to\
    \ convey to expectant parents is that whatever costs are encountered during labor\
    \ and delivery can be amortized into the price of the birth experience over a\
    \ number of years. For example, many birthing-center clients find that the cost\
    \ of a midwife\u2019s services over a number of years is less than the price of\
    \ routine prenatal care over the same amount of time. And, for couples who prefer\
    \ out-of-hospital births, the cost of the services of an individual birth professional,\
    \ such as a doula, may well be spread out over several years.\r\n     \r\n   \
    \ Question:\r\n    What should I look for in a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Choosing\
    \ a doula is similar to choosing any other birth support person or professional.\
    \ While doulas are not required for a safe birth, they are highly recommended.\
    \ The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) states that \u201C\
    during the period of labor, pregnant women may benefit from continuous emotional\
    \ support of a doula.\u201D3 The American College of Nurse-Midwives (ACNM) states,\
    \ \u201Cthe doula may be provided by the health care provider, a consumer advocacy\
    \ group, or by other sources, but remains an individual, paid person.\u201D4 The\
    \ National Perinatal Association supports the role of the individual doula as\
    \ part of the birth team.5,6 Doulas are generally independent contractors, not\
    \ employees. An essential part of birth support is the formation of trust between\
    \ a woman and her doula. The doula must be someone who understands and believes\
    \ in birth and who has no competing agendas or interests (other than the baby\u2019\
    s) during the birth.\r\n    Question:\r\n    Should a doula be someone I know?\r\
    \n    Answer:\r\n    Anyone who is passionate about birth and knows about doula\
    \ services may be recommended by someone as a candidate for a doula. Many doulas\
    \ begin as labor support partners or birth assistants for friends and family.\
    \ Including their own family members during birth preparation helps the doula\
    \ to understand the needs of the birthing family. Once they have had a few successful\
    \ experiences, they may decide to extend their labor support to more families.\
    \ Doulas may also be recruited from professional organizations, such as the Birthworks\
    \ Association (see Resources). Doulas who are employed through childbirth educator\
    \ organizations may require that clients become their childbirth class participants\
    \ first. Some doulas may also be certified and have received training to perform\
    \ other health-care-related functions, such as midwifery and massage. Whether\
    \ a doula is recommended by a family member or not, it is important that the support\
    \ person be someone who can understand and share the birthing family\u2019s thoughts,\
    \ feelings, and beliefs on the birth process. It is important to discuss the relationship\
    \ that the doula will have with other members of the birth team, including the\
    \ midwife, obstetrician, and other caregivers, such as the birth partner or nurse.\r\
    \n    Question:\r\n    What should I look for in a doula?\r\n    Answer:\r\n \
    \   Choosing a doula is similar to choosing any other birth support person or\
    \ professional. While doulas are not required for a safe birth, they are highly\
    \ recommended. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG)\
    \ states that \u201Cduring the period of labor, pregnant women may benefit from\
    \ continuous emotional support of a doula.\u201D3 The American College of Nurse-Midwives\
    \ (ACNM) states,\r\n```\r\n\r\nTemp at 0.9, repetition 1.2:\r\n\r\n```\r\nQuestion:\r\
    \n    Are doulas needed if I deliver at home or in a hospital setting like where\
    \ my sister gave birth last year after going through prenatal classes with another\
    \ nurse practitioner?\r\n    Answer:\r\n    Yes! Whether giving birth inside a\
    \ private birth center, at my birthing unit located within a Birth Center, Inc.,\
    \ in West Orange, New Jersey; at one of our hospice houses in southern California;\
    \ or even on the floor at home among your closest friends and relatives, you\u2019\
    ll want someone there who fully understands what you're working toward\u2014the\
    \ kindness and caring provided by a highly skilled professional doula. We know\
    \ every step leading up to, throughout, and beyond the actual delivery\u2014and\
    \ the healing needed afterwards.\r\n    Of all those places mentioned above for\
    \ birthing\u2014I must say\u2014that first choice belongs right in your own home\
    \ . This means both physical location plus emotional environs, too\u2026 meaning\
    \ people YOU choose being there with you for this special moment in time!\r\n\
    \    Let me tell you why...\r\n     In contrast to most traditional doctor-run\
    \ \u201Cmaternities,\u201D we believe that each patient deserves individualized\
    \ treatment based upon her unique needs. Often times, patients suffer unnecessarily\
    \ because of unnecessary interventions. We hope to eliminate unwanted intervention\
    \ so that women can concentrate on enjoying the exciting but sometimes overwhelming\
    \ journey of becoming Mother Nature\u2019s miracle worker: HERSELF!!!\r\n    \

    \ healthcare of pregnant woman AND infants \u2014 they have successfully accomplished\
    \ something truly incredible.\u201D\u2014Goddess Gaia\r\n          Please note:\

    \ diplomas (CNA), certificates, certifications, licenses etc.\r\n            \
