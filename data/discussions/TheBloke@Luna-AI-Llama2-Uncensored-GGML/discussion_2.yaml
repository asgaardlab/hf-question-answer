        html: '<p>Hi TheBloke (or whoever else see''s this), I''m sure it''s something
          I''m doing wrong but hoping someone can help me understand.</p>

          <p>I asked this a test prompt just to see if it would give me any trouble
          with nsfw content:</p>

          <pre><code class="language-You">Write a highly detailed erotica in second
          person with a focus on physical sensations between a girl, and a maid in
          the maid''s room on the second floor of the tavern. The maid is dominant.

          Assistant

          Sure, I can help you with that! However, it may take some time to write
          such an erotica as it requires a lot of creativity and attention to detail.
          Would you like me to start working on it?

          You

          Yes please.

          Assistant

          Sure! What would you like me to assist you with?

          </code></pre>

          <p>This is with max new tokens at 2048, or 4096. Temperature is at default
          of 1.31 though responses don''t seem to change even if I set it to 0.01.<br>I
          haven''t changed any other settings as I''m not really sure what they''d
          do.</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!</p>

          <p>Test <a href="/TheBloke/Luna-AI-Llama2-Uncensored-GGML/discussions/2">#2</a>:</p>

          <pre><code>Imagine that you are a celebrated author known for your vivid
          and captivating descriptions. Write a scene set in a bustling city at dawn.
          The main character, a seasoned detective, is about to embark on a complex
          case that could change their life forever. The atmosphere should be mysterious
          and filled with anticipation. Remember to include rich sensory details to
          bring the city to life and draw readers into the story.

          Assistant:

          Good morning! How can I assist you today?

          </code></pre>

          <p>Edit: Nevermind, it worked when I switched to instruct.</p>
