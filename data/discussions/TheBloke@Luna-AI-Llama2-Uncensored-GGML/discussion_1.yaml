        html: '<p>Hi, thank you as always. This model is exceptional, but I''ve noticed
          through llama.cpp that the Assistant will eventually get to a point that
          it just stops generating before max context.</p>

          <p>It''s randomly stopped around 700, 1100, 1200 a few times even with --context
          2048</p>

          <p>It''s not only your repo, I''ve downloaded  the identical model from
          2 other repos and experienced the same abrupt stop.</p>

          <p>I dunno if there''s a problem with either the dataset, or llama.cpp</p>

          <p>Any experience with this? Hear any similar issues?</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
