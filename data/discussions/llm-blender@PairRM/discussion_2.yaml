          <p>Besides, <code>llm-blender</code> also designs some simple interface
          functions so that PairRM can be properly used, such as <code>compare()</code>,

          integrating with transformers can''t provide these inferfaces.<br>We also
          have set the minimum packages requirements to install <code>llm-blender</code>
