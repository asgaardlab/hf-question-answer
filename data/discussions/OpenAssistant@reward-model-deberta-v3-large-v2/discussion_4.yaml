        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>It can be seen in this repo that you evaluate this model [OpenAssistant/reward-model-deberta-v3-large-v2]
          towards the dataset [Anthropic/hh-rlhf], which contains pairs of good/bad
          multi-turn conversations. </p>

          <p>However, it seems unclear that how to input each multi-turn conversation
          text into this model, for the model requires two text parts and then compute
          a score (according to README). </p>

          <p>I  also refer to [<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/blob/9cb6de07b5014a6f4d6bbaab9e9e1cc8b990bc43/model/model_training/trainer_rm.py%5D">https://github.com/LAION-AI/Open-Assistant/blob/9cb6de07b5014a6f4d6bbaab9e9e1cc8b990bc43/model/model_training/trainer_rm.py]</a>
          for advice. The released code seems to first parse each conversation, then
          replace the role(Human: / Assistant:) with special tokens(&lt;|prompter|&gt;
          / &lt;|assistant|&gt;) and finally concat all turns with the EOS token.
          However, these two special tokens (&lt;|prompter|&gt; / &lt;|assistant|&gt;)  are
          not in the vocabulary of the corresponding tokenizer. </p>

          <p>Hence, I  am wondering that can you kindly show the format of the input
          text for a sample of the dataset [Anthropic/hh-rlhf], or provide a demo,
          which are of great value for me to learn.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
