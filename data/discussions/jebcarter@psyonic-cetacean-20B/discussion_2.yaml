        raw: This model is fantastic at writing fiction, particularly at high temperature
          tweaking and mirostat. I'm not sure what the context size is, but I easily
          hit it. Is there any way to increase the context limit such as using ExLlamav2
          and increasing max_seq_len + compress_pos_emb?
