        html: '<p>Dear Hugging Face Community,</p>

          <p>Jan Bausback and me are currently studying Leadership in Digital Innovation
          at the University of Arts in Berlin.<br>In our recent course on AI and Creativity
          we coded a little sth in VS Code using the Open AI API via Langchain to
          extract information from work calendars by exporting them to csv files and
          prompting GPT to recommend conversation starters based on possible matching
          between several calendars.<br>This could be used in the often awkward start
          of virtual meetings, in order to avoid silence and kickstart the meeting
          in an inspiring and employee-connecting way. </p>

          <p>Feedback and improvements are welcome!</p>

          <p>Challenges that occured:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>the number of tokens that the model can handle is quite limited, maybe
          this is due to the Langchain-Integration? Implying, that the direct use
          of the OpenAI-API would be more efficient, also cost-wise?</li>
