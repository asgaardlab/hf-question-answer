          considering include:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Intel Core i7-873G: This is a high-performance desktop CPU from Intel''s
          8th generation Coffee Lake Refresh lineup. It features six cores with HyperThreading,
          making it suitable for demanding tasks like gaming, content creation, and
          multimedia applications.</li>

          <li>AMD Ryzen 5 465G: This is an AM4 platform based multi-core CPU designed
          by AMD for mainstream consumers. The 5 465G offers excellent value for money
          due to its performance per watt ratio. It has 5 cores and SMT (Simultaneous
          Multi-threading) which makes it a great choice for gamers as well as content
          creators who need maximum parallel processing power.</li>

          <li>Intel Core i9-108: This is also a top-tier desktop CPU from the Skylake-X
          architecture, featuring 12 cores with HyperThreading, making it ideal for
          professional content creation, gaming, and other compute-intensive tasks
          where high core count matters.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Please note that the best consumer CPU may vary depending on individual
          needs, budgets, and specific use cases. Always consult current reviews and
          comparisons to make an informed decision based on your requirements.</p>
