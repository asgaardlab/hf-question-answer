        html: '<p>Hello Harborwater,</p>

          <p>first and foremost, thank you for your  models!</p>

          <p>I wanted to inform you that I''ve taken the initiative to convert your
          models to .GGUF for use in Llama.cpp software. This particular model  can
          be found <a href="https://huggingface.co/maddes8cht/harborwater-wizard-orca-3b-gguf">here</a>,
          and the entire collection, including other OpenLlama conversions, is available
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/maddes8cht/open-llama-gguf-6554be6495885c0796c026a6">here</a>.</p>

          <p>So, as there is only ONE 3b version of Llama, and i was able to convert
          this thing here with a Llama converter script, this Model too must be an
          OpenLlama descendant, isn''t it?<br>While I understand that it''s acceptable
          not to include OpenLlama in the model name (as you did in all your other
          Models), I believe adding a note in the model card about its OpenLlama descendant
          status would be beneficial for clarity.</p>

          <p>I refer to this model as an OpenLlama descendant, and I would like to
          have a confirmation if that is correct?</p>

          <p>If you find it fitting, linking back to the converted models on your
          README.md files could create a mutually beneficial connection.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your time and consideration.</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>maddes8cht</p>
