        html: '<p>I am encountering a weird issue where tokenizing and then decoding
          substrings results in inconsistent outputs depending on context. Take this
          string for instance:<br>"23  year old  Michael   '' Jos ''   Surgeon  was

          ''" the output does not change at all and I receive back  "'' Jos  ''"  (with
          spaces between the ''). However when I tokenize and decode the whole string
          at once I get back:<br>"23 year old Michael''Jos''Surgeon was last seen
          at Oakland. He is described as Native American, 5''8", and 210 lbs "<br>Notice
          there are no longer spaces in-between the single quotes for the word "''Jos''"</p>

          <p>Is there any way to stop this or at the very least know what the tokenizer
          will tokenize a substring to in the whole sentence tokenization? I am using
          tokenizer.encode_plus() as a side note and loading from pretrained of flan-t5-large.
