        html: '<p>Yeah I could. You certainly don''t want to be downloading all of

          was a PR added to text-gen a few weeks ago which would allow individual
          file download from a repo, I thought that was going to be merged and then
          it''d be easy to download a single file from in the UI.  But it''s not been
          merged yet, not sure why.</p>

          <p>I''ll investigate the state of that PR and if it doesn''t look like it''s
          going to be merged, I''ll see about branches for GGML also.</p>
