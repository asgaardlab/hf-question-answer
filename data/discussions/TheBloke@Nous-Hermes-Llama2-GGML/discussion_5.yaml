        html: '<p>When I ask questions like who played Alan Harper''s ex-wife on Two
          and a Half Men it gives a way off base answer ("Conchita portrayed by Rose

          Bowlby (Kandi). Then when I ask it to try again it said Rose (a non-wife
          character), and so on as I pressed it. Almost every question I ask, such
          as who sang a particular song, or what song included this lyric, resulted
          in a hallucination. LLama1 13b wasn''t near as bad. GPT3.5 passed all my
          questions (dozens), and Wizard 1.1 based on Llama 1 passed most. There''s
