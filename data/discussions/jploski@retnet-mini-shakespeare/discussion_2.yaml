        html: '<p>Well, in a way it is in fact a "bleeding edge model" because it
          is not included as a model type in HuggingFace''s transformers library.
          So I suppose the demo on the website won''t work. Instead you could try
          the Google Colab notebook linked from the model page, which I just updated
          to work with the current version of syncdoth/RetNet code. Or just download
          the model files and run it locally, using an inference script like shown
          in the Colab notebook.</p>
