        html: '<p>Hi,<br>I really like your approach and really interesting stuff.
          Since I am kind of new to the flan-T5 model and i have similar problem like
          you . Based on your experience with this model, do you think it is possible
          to generate a python dictionary given a text containing 1-2 sentences with
          this flan-t5? I already have a dataset for this, what I am currently doing
          is looking for a suitable model for my problem. </p>

          <p>Any hint would be really appreciate it!</p>

          <p>Cheers,<br>ai</p>
