        html: '<p>I ran this successfully on a home PC with a GeForce 4090 RTX. It
          ran on oobabooga. I''m sharing my success or failure of running these models
          larger than 13b locally to save some people time, disk, and bandwidth.</p>

          <p>This model hallucinates pretty bad. I may try changing some settings
          like temperature so I can leverage the huge context window, but for now
          I will move on to others.</p>
