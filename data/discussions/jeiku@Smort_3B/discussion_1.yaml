          I''m working on trying to merge bigger models with small ones, on that repo
          I merged Silicon-Maid-7B with Sheared-LLaMA-2.7B-ShareGPT, 2 trials, one
          at 10% and other at 33%, I have the original too(without anything on top,
          to compare), and I did one with Kunoichi-7B at 33% too.<br>Just if you have
          time(and if you want, it''s not a obligation), I''m pretty bad at testing,
          and I''m not sure if the models have acquired some of the behavior of the
          larger models, sometimes it tends to produce gibberish unfortunately.</p>

          in a manner that makes sense during riddles, but it seemed to handle conversation
          and roleplay relatively well. Silicon 10% was the best of the the mixed
          models and responded quite well to both the riddle and roleplay (though
          it did not correctly answer the riddle, though that is rare in 3B models.)
          Finally I tested the original to see where baseline was and saw quite a
          bit of it in the others. It sometimes spoke in sentence fragments like Silicon
          33%, but otherwise performed well. I would still say that Silicon 10% was
          the best of the batch. </p>
