        html: '<p>Hi! Thanks for the additions :)</p>

          <p>To answer the question, JFLEG is a <em>part</em> of the dataset used
          to fine-tune the models, but it''s much more than that - I''ve written some
          details <a href="https://huggingface.co/pszemraj/flan-t5-large-grammar-synthesis/discussions/5">here</a>
          (<em>if this one doesn''t have all of it, I recommend checking the other
          closed discussions too as I discussed more details/stats on the dataset
          etc</em>),  but basically it''s a lot of augmentations on both <code>val</code>
          and <code>test</code> of JFLEG and some other custom data, which after several
          steps in my pipeline I then finally split back into train/test/validation,
          then train the text2text model on that. </p>

          <p>I was/am waiting until I had a chance to create an improved version of
          the dataset, compute some metrics, write a short paper or blog post about
          it, and then release the dataset. Unfortunately, I have been too busy to
          get to that, but hopefully later this year! When I do release an improved
          version, I plan to drop JFLEG altogether so that it can be released under
          a much more permissive license.</p>

          <p>BTW - Grammarly released <a href="https://huggingface.co/grammarly/coedit-xl-composite">some
          models</a> and a paper about their custom dataset and method earlier this
          year, you might be interested in that. Unfortunately AFAIK it the dataset
          itself has not been released yet, I have <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/vipulraheja/coedit/issues/3">an
          open issue here</a></p>

          <p>Hope this helps!</p>
