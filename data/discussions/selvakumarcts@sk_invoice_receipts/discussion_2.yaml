        html: '<p>Hello, </p>

          <p>Please could you update this to allow the deployment of Inference endpoints
          for this please?</p>

          <p>I tried to do it but it says "Warning: deploying this model may fail
          because a "handler.py" file was not found in the repository. Try selecting
          a different model or creating a custom handler."</p>

          <p>Thank you </p>
