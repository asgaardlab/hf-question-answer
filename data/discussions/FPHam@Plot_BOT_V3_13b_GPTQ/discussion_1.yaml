        html: '<p>Any chance you could release a GGUF of this? </p>

          <p>I''d love to try it, but I''m on a M1 Mac... so a little bit of nvidia-envy
          going on here. On the other hand, at q5 or q8 quant would be great since
          my system ram is shared with the gpu.</p>

          <p>And please don''t bother if this is too much trouble. I''m new, so I
          don''t really know if I''m asking for something easy or hard.</p>

          <p>Either way, thanks in advance! </p>
