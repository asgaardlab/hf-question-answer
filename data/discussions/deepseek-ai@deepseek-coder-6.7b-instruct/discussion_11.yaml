        html: '<p>I think it would be really amazing if you guys took the Mixtral
          model and trained it on your coding data. It would probably code as good
          or better than the 33b-instruct coder you already have, and it would as
          good on other tasks that your coding models struggle in that the non coding
          models are good at. Plus it would run as fast as a 14b parameter model despite
          being over 40b parameters large because of the nature of the Mixtral architecture.
          </p>

          <p>Idk if you guys are able to or not because of politics and company policies
          and all that. But you should at least seriously consider it. Because you
          could make the best Mixtral model with your datasets so idk maybe think
          about the benefits for your investors and income it could make. </p>

          <p>Have a good day! </p>
