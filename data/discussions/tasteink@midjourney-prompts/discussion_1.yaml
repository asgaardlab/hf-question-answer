        html: '<p>In the front chest position of graduation shirt, a simple and modern

          <p>Green leaves: Green leaves are the symbol of agriculture and plants,
          representing the core field of agricultural college. Simple shapes and lines

          <p>Crops: One or two common crops, such as wheat, corn and rice, can be
          added to the icon. These crops represent the bumper harvest of agriculture

          <p>Technological elements: Consider incorporating some technological elements

          elements can represent the modernization of agricultural colleges and the
          importance of scientific research.</p>

          <p>Dynamic sense: use streamlined lines and gradient colors to add some
          dynamic and modern sense to the icon.</p>

          <p>On the back of the graduation shirt, you can choose to add the logo or
          name of the Agricultural College on the shoulder or back. This will allow
          graduates to show their colleges when they wear them.</p>

          <p>Finally, choose a color scheme suitable for the image of agricultural
