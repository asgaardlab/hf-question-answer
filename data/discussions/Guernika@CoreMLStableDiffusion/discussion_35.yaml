  content: "Sounds great, Thanks you for your work :)\nThe New Update is veeeeeery\
    \ interesting, the LCM is quite FAST ! \nA few question about this :\n\n- Where\
    \ has the negative prompt gone, is it by the nature of LCM ?\n- Will we be able\
    \ to make custom LCMs in the converter ? I'm confused with the official description\
    \ (LCMs can be distilled from any pre-trained Stable Diffusion (SD) in only 4,000\
    \ training steps (~32 A100 GPU Hours)\n- This models removed the cap on 1024px,\
    \ what about the older pre-update models ? (I could never make higher custom res\
    \ anyway, my computer struggles and eats a big chunk of swap on 32g M1 Max)\n\n\
    May I suggest few more minimal stuffs :\n- QuickLook preview API onto images would\
    \ be nice, I tend to press spacebar while I'm navigating in the collections to\
    \ see closer :D\n- Is it possible to take inspiration from a certain detailer\
    \ extension and return the positions of faces as a shortcuts action ? there is\
    \ no cross-platform Shortcuts solution anywhere.\n(Although, I previewed YOLOv3\
    \ from Apple ML dev page and YOLOv8 from \"john-rocky/CoreML-Models\", they highlights\
    \ full bodies AND faces as \"person\" so this will probably fail as is ?)\n\n\
    - \"Share\", \"Add to Photo\" drops the image in the library, any chance to drop\
    \ it into an album ?"

    ,  here is what I got from Console : \n![Capture d\u2019e\u0301cran 2023-11-17\

    \n- I guess that iPad limitations prevented you from adding controlnet yet, \n\
    I was wondering if you could at least add T2I adapter there, as the legend says\

    \ can it be merged and detected as LCM model ?\n\nhave a great day"
