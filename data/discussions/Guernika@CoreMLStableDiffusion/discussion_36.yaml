    \n\n- If you want to add the task list function, you can consider using a large\
    \ language model to generate prompt words in batches. This is an example of using\
    \ shortcuts. The effect is very good. llama.cpp also has Swift binding.\nhttps://github.com/czkoko/SD-AI-Prompt\n\
    \n- For Models/Conditioning tabs, if you want to redesign, I think you can change\
    \ it to activate it from a new window in the menu, or a small icon at the top\
    \ of the current window to start a new model management window. After all, its\
    \ daily usage rate is not very high.\n\n- For Collections, I have never created\

  content: "@GuiyeC \nThe design of the job queue looks good, simple and beautiful.\n\
    I found that each step of the LCM model can produce pictures with similar overall\
    \ and completely different details. \nI want to know if it is in the 4, 5, 6step...\
    \ Will there be good quality for the decoding and saving of latent images? Or\
    \ have to start a new sample from step 1?\nIf feasible, this can be used as a\
    \ workflow to generate similar pictures.\n\nI think we can add a help page to\
    \ the menu bar, because many new users don't know how to use, convert models,\
    \ and install models correctly.\n\nHere are some suggestions for UI:\n\n1. For\
    \ non-square-scale pictures, you may be able to set a blurred square background\
    \ for them, Or a monochrome that is slightly different from the bottom background\
    \ color, so that various proportions of pictures may look more neat together.\n\
