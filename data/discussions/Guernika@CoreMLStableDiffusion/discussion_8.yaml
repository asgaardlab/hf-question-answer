        html: '<p>I bought the app recently and was playing around with it a bit.
          I also use Mochi Diffusion and Prompt2Image. I was hoping to benefit from
          the inpainting functionality using CoreML which is not implemented in the
          other two apps so far. Unfortunately the app still has a lot of bugs and
          quirks which will hopefully ironed out in future versions. Some of my observations:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Some models that work fine in other apps just crash Guernika on load</li>

          <li>There is no way to see the generation data of an image from within the
          app (copying prompts and seeds should be possible easily)</li>

          <li>The gallery is very confusing. I still have no idea what the purpose
          of those subfolders is in all images?!</li>

          <li>In inpainting mode, if you want to change the base image, there is no
          such option available. It only works by changing tabs, going back, clearing
          and then choosing another image. The mask though stays even though the base
          image was changed</li>

          <li>Also the mask option overlay window disappears randomly (same workaround
          necessary to get it back)</li>

          <li>The full prompt data should be saved with the PNG</li>

          <li>What is the Copy command intended to do in the context menu of an image</li>

          <li>You cannot get an image from the gallery into the inpainting window</li>

          <li>Adding external images (even when 512x512) to the inpainting window,
          unloads the selected model and/or crashes the app on generation</li>

          <li>I had a two cases of memory leaks that crashed my whole machine</li>

          <li>This is probably a CoreML limitation but inpainting seems to very rudimentary
          in comparison to WebUI.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>And finally a question: What is the recommended inpainting model atm
          (1.5.or 2.1)? What are the differences?</p>

          <p>Keep up the good work and I''m sure in the near future we will have a
          few really good SD apps that will come close to what is possible with WebUI
          or Invoke with the rocket speed of Apple Silicon Neural Engine!!!</p>
