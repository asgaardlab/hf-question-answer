          on how to use the new converter ?</p>

          <ul>

          <li>I tried textual inversion (.pt) but didn''t work, I guess there is a
          conversion step before that ? (I was lazy I just converted "text-encoder"
          and replaced those files)</li>

          <li>Looks like custom controlnet res, can you help or list a controlnet
          list, didn''t try Illyasviel repo cause it felt wrong (5gb)?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Congratulations, amazing job</p>

          \ ! Thanks for the comment :)</p>\n<ul>\n<li>On textual inversion, you should\
          \ select a folder with the embedding/s inside, after that make sure you\
          \ are converting the TextEncoder (is the only one affected) and that \u201C\
          Load embeddings\u201D is enabled. Once converted you should be able to right\
          \ click \u201CShow package contents\u201D on the TextEncoder.mlmodelc and\
          \ there should be a new added_vocab.json with the new tokens, those are\
          \ the token you should used. If that worked you can replace in the model\u2019\
          s folder the TextEncoder and load it in Guernika and it should work. There\
          \ is a new version Guernika 3.0 waiting for review by Apple that makes managing\
          \ and changing the TextEncoder easier but on the latest one it should work\
          \ already by manually changing it.</li>\n<li>For ControlNet you can use\
          \ the ones listed <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel\">here</a>\
          \ for 1.X or <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/thibaud\">here</a> for 2.x.\

          \ them all, I\u2019m sure there are other ones already but I haven\u2019\

  content: "@GuiyeC \n\nSure, here are the steps to reproduce :\n1. generate one image\
    \ with new added TI token, but on default text-encoder.\n2. switch to \"new text\
    \ encoder\", generate the same, same seed == image(1) and image(2) are the same.\n\
    3. I restart Guernika, select \"new text encoder\" generate the same, same seed,\
    \ image is now different (TI working), and vice versa, notices a few crashed when\
    \ playing a lot with the select-menu, maybe that's just my computer.\n\n- Affirmative,\
    \ this one link !\n- an important feature to me is img2img mask, similar to inputting\
    \ brush, to add details here and there protecting the rest of the image, specially\
    \ the \"whole-image\"vs\"only-masked\"  option like the popular webui.\n With\
    \ \"only-masked\" activated it creates an area around the painted area, and treat\
    \ it as a full res img2img input\nthere is a blend-padding slider to control how\
    \ it blends around the painted brush or something like that.\n\nYou once proposed\
    \ a draggable square zone a-la-Dall-e, pretty challenging, I supposed its the\
    \ same spirit (I'm all for it!)\nIt could be some unified tab for inpainting-outpainting-addingdetails\
    \ : \nYou could delete/inpaint, or mask+img2img on the canvas, (edit :) Dragging\
    \ and panning/zooming the canvas around while the square selection stays centered,\
    \ everything under the square is considered 512x512 image input, Idk :)\n\nI also\
    \ noticed that when you drop 512x768 into let's say 640x960 img2img input, W and\
    \ H are reversed (saw that on apple's repo too), causing a missing space in generation\
    \ also visible in img2img preview, but if you resize it manually using Preview\
    \ app at 640x960 and use this as input it works as is... maybe if you resize it\
    \ via Guernika you got a quick fix.\nI'm very pleased on how it adds details so\
    \ much quicker than the popular web-ui (the timer count is off while using this\
    \ upscaling technique, but it's what, 30-40 seconds total, nothing like 4minutes\
    \ on the web-ui). That's good !\n\n\nIf you are looking for new challenges I also\
