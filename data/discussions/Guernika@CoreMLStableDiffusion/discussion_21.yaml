    \ the famous webui upscalers : \nI would slice an image outside of Guernika into\
    \ 512x512 and process each one as Shortcut Input and stitch them back together\
    \ (how does controlnetTile work here, I honestly don't know)\nSo we could handling\
    \ the fades, overlaps and collages outside of Guernika so you won't have to, But\
    \ I won't be bothered if you want to keep your precious App on the spotlight.\n\
    \n- text encoder in Shortcut is important to me ^^\n\n(edited : shower thoughts\

  content: "Hello @GuiyeC \nAmazing ! \nI don't see anything wrong there :)\nYes I\
    \ understand the challenges, Shortcuts probably has more limits but is more user-friendly\
    \ than my initial AppleScript approach, \nglad you still took a look at it, I\
    \ apologize if I assumed Shortcuts works a certain way. \n\n- Maybe add Preprocessors\
    \ in a separate action ? Shortcut will decide to crash itself or not, thus, user\
    \ will decide if he choose to chain [Preprocessing + Controlnet] or batch preprocessing\
    \ before-hand, so yes, separate preprocessor and controlNet action are wanted\
    \ :) \nWe'd have to match image input+controlnet input afterwards in a batch,\
    \ that's tricky, also, where to save ? inside a collection ? We'll figure it out.\n\
    \nSounds good to me cause I'd split my workflow into a series a little scripts\
    \ 1,2,3,4, with that idea of [Upscale>Tiling>Img2img>Collage] I'd put a pause\
    \ to fix little things manually before step 3.\nThe simpler the better I guess.\n\
    \n- What do you mean inpainting action, like Set a mask from external sources\
    \ ? \nIt's important but the \"prepared masks\" certainly feels not fun to do.\
    \ Can you pop-up the Inpaint-brush menu on demand, and export the mask separately\
    \ ? Same splitting energy, same problem to match them up afterwards. \nAlso, with\
    \ exported masks we could approach the \"inpaint masked-area-only\" option if\
    \ we blend it ourselves, but I guess ppl want it builtin ;)\n\nOutpainting, how\
    \ ? I can't wrap my head around that today.\n\nYou should release it as experimental\
    \ and we'd gladly provide feedbacks :)\n\n------\n\nOff Subject : \n- Will Textual\
    \ Inversion come to iPad ? Not a big user on this device, but I like to showoff\
    \ ;)\n- Can you take a look at Reference_only and ControlNetTile \n- If ControlNet\
    \ Inpaint replaces inpaint models, we'd need a mask on the controlNet area or\
    \ something ?\n- How is SDXL implementation going ? 1024x1024 feels hard to generate.\n\
    - Did you get a hand on the next OS beta ? Will the quantized model leave more\
    \ space for ANE to work, or maybe make images superior to 512x512 ?\n\nWish you\
    \ the best !\n"

        raw: '@ZProphete thanks for the response :) I''m glad you like it!


          Shortcuts should be out in iPad in the next update, I have to work in the
          iPad and iOS UIs to add some of the new features first, I''m not sure how
          reliable they will be in lower memory devices though.


          I thought the converter could have problems, I tried to keep it compatible
          with SDXL and older models and it seemed to be working, do you have a specific
          one that''s failing so I can test with it?

          I don''t want to add the SDXL model for now, I got early access and I don''t
          think I''m able to share the model for now, in any case the official release
          date was supposed to be today so maybe I can post SDXL 1.0 shortly.



          I''ll take a look at the things you mention, and feel free to share any
          other feedback with me :)'
