        html: '<p>Hey Metalx, I am currently using oobabooga and the model loads just
          fine but the model is just stuck while when I use the gpt4 x alpaca 13b
          model it barely uses any vram  and has lightning quick responses. The 100%
          gpu usage, could that be because the 13b model has  cuda optimizations because
          it says that in the file name but that still does explain why my model is
          just stuck on "typing" and never actually responding. But thank you for
          making this model I am looking forward to playing with it!</p>
