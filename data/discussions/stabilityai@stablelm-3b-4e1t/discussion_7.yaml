        html: '<p>Hi StabilityAI team - just wanted to commend you on a great model.   We
          fine-tuned it recently for a RAG-Instruction use case, with excellent results
          - in fact, it has over-performed many of the 7B models that we have fine-tuned
          with this objective.   Check out the link and the results - <a href="https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-stable-lm-3b-4e1t-v0">https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-stable-lm-3b-4e1t-v0</a>
          - which is part of our BLING model instruct / Q&amp;A fine-tuning on small
          model series.    Thanks for the AWESOME work - and would welcome the chance
          to connect and collaborate in the future!</p>
