        html: '<p>Hello, I decided to try your model for communicating with characters
          via SillyTavern. It''s really good, but for some reason it keeps answering
          for me in its own text. It''s like she''s writing a book with a story, instead
          of dialoguing with me like another character. And for example, if I point
          out something that a character will definitely never do, he can very easily
          be persuaded to do it. For example, vicuna 33b no matter how hard I tried,
          wouldn''t let me violate the character''s canon beliefs spelled out in his
          description. I realize that comparing 7b and 33b is ridiculous, but still,
          I want to bring this information to you, maybe you can fix it.<br>I also
          tried to put various prompts for this model, but it had no effect, in the
          worst case the character began to speak as an assistant completely falling
          out of the role.</p>
