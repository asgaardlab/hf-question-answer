          \ Strategy<br>How Tesla\u2019s Charging Stations Left Other Manufacturers\
          \ in the Dust<br>by Hemant Bhargava, Jonas Boehm, and Geoffrey G. Parker\
          \ January 27, 2021<br>VCG/ Getty Images<br>Summary. Mainstream car manufacturers\
          \ are spending billions on developing EVs. Before spending any more money\
          \ they should take a leaf out of Tesla\u2019s books and create a recharging\
          \ network to support their cars. Only then will they be able to treat their\
          \ EVS as a product.... more</p>\n<p>Over the past five years, the major\
          \ auto companies have invested massively in electric vehicles (EVs). The\
          \ Volkswagen Group in 2017 announced that they would offer 80 new electric\
          \ vehicles across their brands by 2025 and electric versions of every one\
          \ of its models by 2030. In the same year GM went public with plans to put\
          \ at least 20 new electric models on the road by 2023. They are not alone;\
          \ Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that 500 different EV models will\
          \ be available globally by 2022.<br>Yet, despite investments that add up\
          \ to many billions of dollars, none of the major incumbent automakers seems\
          \ to pose much of a threat to market leader Tesla, which has become nearly\
          \ synonymous with EVs. This is surprising since one might reasonably have\
          \ expected that once firms with annual revenues in excess of $100B, deep\
          \ manufacturing expertise, and large market shares turned their attention\
          \ to the electric vehicle market, the game would be up.<br>The reason why\
          \ consumers still choose Teslas over products like Audi\u2019s eTron or\
          \ attractive EVs from GM\u2019s Buick, Cadillac, GMC, and Chevy brands is\
          \ perhaps surprisingly simple. They can drive their Teslas for long distances\
          \ in full confidence that they will find convenient locations at which to\
          \ recharge their vehicle. While the incumbent automakers are still focused\
          \ narrowly on perfecting their electric cars, Tesla has been thinking about\
          \ the entire vehicle system, with the aim of solving consumers\u2019 core\
          \ driving needs.<br>The car as platform<br>A car creates value to its owner\
          \ when it is driven, which requires refueling. Automakers of gasoline cars\
          \ or trucks do not have to worry about this, as refueling stations are abundant\
          \ \u2014 over 160,000 stations are in the United States alone \u2014 and\
          \ easily accessible. They have therefore built their strategies around standard\
          \ marketing variables: product, price, placement, promotion. Build a great\
          \ car (or truck), advertise it heavily, offer it in the right markets at\
          \ a good price, and the product will sell.</p>\n<p>An electric car, however,\
          \ requires a different value analysis. \u201CRefueling stations\u201D \u2014\
          \ i.e., rapid charging facilities \u2014 for electric vehicles are in their\
          \ infancy, with only about 4,000 available in the United States. Moreover,\
          \ the network of available charging stations is highly fractured across\
          \ ownership and technology. The next largest network, compared to Tesla,\
          \ is only 10% as large. Unless you buy a Tesla, you have few options for\
          \ reliable route planning, guaranteed access, and rapid public charging.<br>An\
          \ electric car, therefore, is a two-sided platform good, the two sides being\
          \ an installed base of car buyers and a large network of geographically\
          \ dispersed multi-stall rapid-charging stations. Selling electric cars requires\
          \ a robust charging network. But, investments in building a massive charging\
          \ network make sense only if there is a large enough user base and demand\
          \ for these chargers. Tesla has such a network, and everyone else\u2019\
          s is laughable. How did this happen and what can Tesla\u2019s history teach\
          \ us?<br>Platforms need networks<br>Nissan, with the zippy and relatively\
          \ affordable Leaf, stole an early lead in the EV market, and was the best-selling\
          \ electric car from 2011 to 2014. Despite this lead, Nissan failed to provide\
          \ a robust fast- charging network which left buyers relying on a small number\
          \ of third-party stations available to all brands.<br>Tesla\u2019s approach\
          \ was strikingly different. They began with a vanity product, the Roadster,\
          \ that got them off the ground and generated some early sales. They then\
          \ moved on to release the Model S in 2012, which for its few years (2013-15)\
          \ had roughly a one-year waiting period. To support the cars, however, Tesla\
          \ rolled out a coast-to-coast proprietary network. So, although Tesla sold\
          \ only a few thousand cars in its early years, it had built out a huge network.\
          \ This addressed the buyer\u2019s \u201Crange anxiety\u201D problem \u2014\
          \ no one who considered buying a Tesla needed to worry much about charging.</p>\n\
          <p>Most automakers have followed Nissan\u2019s approach and are focusing\
          \ investments on making better electric cars. But imagine if, instead of\
          \ investing tens of billions of dollars in producing cars with no way to\
          \ drive long distances individually, Audi, GM, Ford, and the rest each spent\
          \ just a billion dollars to build a network of supercharging stations. In\
          \ North America, that amount would finance approximately 1,000 locations\
          \ with 10 charging stalls each. If the stations were correctly placed, a\
          \ network of that size should give buyers enough confidence to choose a\
          \ car based on its features instead of on the features and the charging\
          \ network. Then firms could begin the work of reaching viable volumes, bringing\
          \ costs down, and eventually becoming serious competitors to Tesla.<br>The\
          \ platform advantage<br>Employing a proprietary platform strategy, as Tesla\
          \ did, enables the platform owner to coordinate the two sides of the market:\
          \ the installed base of cars and the network of charging stations. Because\
          \ it owns the charging network, Tesla can choose how to price (whether to\
          \ make charging free and monetize only the car), the number of stations,\
          \ rollout timing, and location.<br>These choices can reflect Tesla\u2019\
          s overall business strategy and detailed knowledge of where the buyers are\
          \ and where they drive. Interestingly, another newcomer, Rivian (which has\
          \ yet to sell a single vehicle) is also building a proprietary charging\
          \ network, like Tesla\u2019s. Rivian is splitting its stations between major\
          \ highways and campgrounds, a perfect fit given its focus on electric adventure\
          \ vehicles.<br>Automakers would be well advised to take a leaf out of Tesla\u2019\
          s playbook and focus on the network before heavily investing in designing\
          \ and manufacturing new EVs, or at least do so in parallel. They may not\
          \ actually have to build the network \u2014 they could instead partner with\
          \ firms that have networks that could accommodate</p>\n<p>recharging stations.\
          \ Many existing fossil fuel energy firms, for example, have gas station\
          \ assets that will eventually become stranded and could be repurposed for\
          \ electric vehicles.<br>Focusing on the network, of course, is not without\
          \ its risks. Rolling out a network from scratch isn\u2019t a trivial challenge,\
          \ nor is it clear that potential partners would be willing to commit to\
          \ an exclusive relationship with any one automaker, which the latter would\
          \ need, at least to begin with, in order to get a head start on the other\
          \ automakers. But investing in a network will certainly increase the odds\
          \ of winning a dominant position in EVs, which a focus on the<br>cars alone\
          \ is unlikely to deliver \u2014 at least according to the evidence so far.<br>Looking\
          \ ahead<br>It\u2019s clear that Tesla itself is doubling down on its Big\
          \ Tech platform strategy. At present, its business model for its new automated\
          \ driving capability is classic product pricing; levy a one-time upcharge\
          \ of $10,000. However, it plans to switch to selling automated driving as\
          \ a service for a monthly fee. This strategy implicitly defines the car\
          \ itself as a platform on top of which services can be delivered.<br>Such\
          \ a business model offers the additional benefit of enabling Tesla to gather\
          \ the training data that the machine learning algorithms for true self-driving\
          \ cars will need, which will confer a critical advantage in the next stage\
          \ of motor vehicle competition. As for the competition around charging networks,\
          \ should other firms get serious about building out alternatives, then we\
          \ would expect Tesla to open its own network since the advantage to remaining\
          \ closed would start to fade. Indeed, we are beginning to see initial signs\
          \ of openness as Tesla hints at allowing a new partner to connect.<br>Firms\
          \ that dream of being the next Tesla should carefully examine why they are\
          \ so far behind. It\u2019s not for lack of knowledge about how to build\
          \ cars; many of the incumbent firms have been doing that for over a hundred\
          \ years. Instead, they should focus on the critical infrastructure, in this\
          \ case the charging networks, that have made</p>\n<p>customers willing to\
          \ take a chance on a newcomer. And, once they\u2019ve done that, they can\
          \ begin to address the next battleground: control over the vehicle data\
          \ that will enable self-driving cars and the transition to vehicle as a\

          \ deep manufacturing expertise, and large market shares turned their attention\
          \ to the electric vehicle market, the game would be up.\nThe reason why\
          \ consumers still choose Teslas over products like Audi\u2019s eTron or\
          \ attractive EVs from GM\u2019s Buick, Cadillac, GMC, and Chevy brands is\
          \ perhaps surprisingly simple. They can drive their Teslas for long distances\
          \ in full confidence that they will find convenient locations at which to\
          \ recharge their vehicle. While the incumbent automakers are still focused\
          \ narrowly on perfecting their electric cars, Tesla has been thinking about\
          \ the entire vehicle system, with the aim of solving consumers\u2019 core\
          \ driving needs.\nThe car as platform\nA car creates value to its owner\
          \ when it is driven, which requires refueling. Automakers of gasoline cars\
          \ or trucks do not have to worry about this, as refueling stations are abundant\
          \ \u2014 over 160,000 stations are in the United States alone \u2014 and\
          \ easily accessible. They have therefore built their strategies around standard\
          \ marketing variables: product, price, placement, promotion. Build a great\
          \ car (or truck), advertise it heavily, offer it in the right markets at\
          \ a good price, and the product will sell.\n\nAn electric car, however,\
          \ requires a different value analysis. \u201CRefueling stations\u201D \u2014\
          \ i.e., rapid charging facilities \u2014 for electric vehicles are in their\
          \ infancy, with only about 4,000 available in the United States. Moreover,\
          \ the network of available charging stations is highly fractured across\
          \ ownership and technology. The next largest network, compared to Tesla,\
          \ is only 10% as large. Unless you buy a Tesla, you have few options for\
          \ reliable route planning, guaranteed access, and rapid public charging.\n\
          An electric car, therefore, is a two-sided platform good, the two sides\
          \ being an installed base of car buyers and a large network of geographically\
          \ dispersed multi-stall rapid-charging stations. Selling electric cars requires\
          \ a robust charging network. But, investments in building a massive charging\
          \ network make sense only if there is a large enough user base and demand\
          \ for these chargers. Tesla has such a network, and everyone else\u2019\
          s is laughable. How did this happen and what can Tesla\u2019s history teach\
          \ us?\nPlatforms need networks\nNissan, with the zippy and relatively affordable\
          \ Leaf, stole an early lead in the EV market, and was the best-selling electric\
          \ car from 2011 to 2014. Despite this lead, Nissan failed to provide a robust\
          \ fast- charging network which left buyers relying on a small number of\
          \ third-party stations available to all brands.\nTesla\u2019s approach was\
          \ strikingly different. They began with a vanity product, the Roadster,\
          \ that got them off the ground and generated some early sales. They then\
          \ moved on to release the Model S in 2012, which for its few years (2013-15)\
          \ had roughly a one-year waiting period. To support the cars, however, Tesla\
          \ rolled out a coast-to-coast proprietary network. So, although Tesla sold\
          \ only a few thousand cars in its early years, it had built out a huge network.\
          \ This addressed the buyer\u2019s \u201Crange anxiety\u201D problem \u2014\
          \ no one who considered buying a Tesla needed to worry much about charging.\n\
          \nMost automakers have followed Nissan\u2019s approach and are focusing\
          \ investments on making better electric cars. But imagine if, instead of\
          \ investing tens of billions of dollars in producing cars with no way to\
          \ drive long distances individually, Audi, GM, Ford, and the rest each spent\
          \ just a billion dollars to build a network of supercharging stations. In\
          \ North America, that amount would finance approximately 1,000 locations\
          \ with 10 charging stalls each. If the stations were correctly placed, a\
          \ network of that size should give buyers enough confidence to choose a\
          \ car based on its features instead of on the features and the charging\
          \ network. Then firms could begin the work of reaching viable volumes, bringing\
          \ costs down, and eventually becoming serious competitors to Tesla.\nThe\
          \ platform advantage\nEmploying a proprietary platform strategy, as Tesla\
          \ did, enables the platform owner to coordinate the two sides of the market:\
          \ the installed base of cars and the network of charging stations. Because\
          \ it owns the charging network, Tesla can choose how to price (whether to\
          \ make charging free and monetize only the car), the number of stations,\
          \ rollout timing, and location.\nThese choices can reflect Tesla\u2019s\
          \ overall business strategy and detailed knowledge of where the buyers are\
          \ and where they drive. Interestingly, another newcomer, Rivian (which has\
          \ yet to sell a single vehicle) is also building a proprietary charging\
          \ network, like Tesla\u2019s. Rivian is splitting its stations between major\
          \ highways and campgrounds, a perfect fit given its focus on electric adventure\
          \ vehicles.\nAutomakers would be well advised to take a leaf out of Tesla\u2019\
          s playbook and focus on the network before heavily investing in designing\
          \ and manufacturing new EVs, or at least do so in parallel. They may not\
          \ actually have to build the network \u2014 they could instead partner with\
          \ firms that have networks that could accommodate\n\nrecharging stations.\
          \ Many existing fossil fuel energy firms, for example, have gas station\
          \ assets that will eventually become stranded and could be repurposed for\
          \ electric vehicles.\nFocusing on the network, of course, is not without\
          \ its risks. Rolling out a network from scratch isn\u2019t a trivial challenge,\
          \ nor is it clear that potential partners would be willing to commit to\
          \ an exclusive relationship with any one automaker, which the latter would\
          \ need, at least to begin with, in order to get a head start on the other\
          \ automakers. But investing in a network will certainly increase the odds\
          \ of winning a dominant position in EVs, which a focus on the\ncars alone\
          \ is unlikely to deliver \u2014 at least according to the evidence so far.\n\
          Looking ahead\nIt\u2019s clear that Tesla itself is doubling down on its\
          \ Big Tech platform strategy. At present, its business model for its new\
          \ automated driving capability is classic product pricing; levy a one-time\
          \ upcharge of $10,000. However, it plans to switch to selling automated\
          \ driving as a service for a monthly fee. This strategy implicitly defines\
          \ the car itself as a platform on top of which services can be delivered.\n\
          Such a business model offers the additional benefit of enabling Tesla to\
          \ gather the training data that the machine learning algorithms for true\
          \ self-driving cars will need, which will confer a critical advantage in\
          \ the next stage of motor vehicle competition. As for the competition around\
          \ charging networks, should other firms get serious about building out alternatives,\
          \ then we would expect Tesla to open its own network since the advantage\
          \ to remaining closed would start to fade. Indeed, we are beginning to see\

    \ in the Dust\nby Hemant Bhargava, Jonas Boehm, and Geoffrey G. Parker January\
    \ 27, 2021\nVCG/ Getty Images\nSummary. Mainstream car manufacturers are spending\
    \ billions on developing EVs. Before spending any more money they should take\
    \ a leaf out of Tesla\u2019s books and create a recharging network to support\
    \ their cars. Only then will they be able to treat their EVS as a product....\
    \ more\n\nOver the past five years, the major auto companies have invested massively\
    \ in electric vehicles (EVs). The Volkswagen Group in 2017 announced that they\
    \ would offer 80 new electric vehicles across their brands by 2025 and electric\
    \ versions of every one of its models by 2030. In the same year GM went public\
    \ with plans to put at least 20 new electric models on the road by 2023. They\
    \ are not alone; Bloomberg New Energy Finance predicts that 500 different EV models\
    \ will be available globally by 2022.\nYet, despite investments that add up to\
    \ many billions of dollars, none of the major incumbent automakers seems to pose\
    \ much of a threat to market leader Tesla, which has become nearly synonymous\

    \ charging network is proprietary, which gives them control over the pricing,\
    \ number of stations, rollout timing, and location. This strategy is a significant\
    \ advantage over the fragmented and fractured charging networks of other automakers.\n\
    \nTo catch up with Tesla, traditional automakers need to shift their focus from\
    \ just the cars to the charging network. They could either build their charging\
    \ networks from scratch, which is a challenging task, or they could partner with\
    \ existing firms that have the infrastructure in place. Some potential partners\
    \ could be fossil fuel energy firms that have gas station assets that will eventually\
    \ become obsolete and could be repurposed for electric"
