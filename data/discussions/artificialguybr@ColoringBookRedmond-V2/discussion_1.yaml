          <p>Normal settings and prompts are what you can find among the hundreds
          of tutorials on the internet. There is no secret. This is a good start.
          The rest is small tests and changes. Datasets, configurations. SD is like
          that. Trial and error. There''s no secret. There is no universal setting,
          although the normal settings will deliver a good result for 99% of people.
          You just need to test if you need a much better lora. Then you go for a
          trial and error. </p>
