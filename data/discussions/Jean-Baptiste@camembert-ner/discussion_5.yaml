        html: '<p>Hello Valentin,</p>

          <p>There is indeed a predefined maximum number of tokens in each model.
          For camembert models this is around 500 tokens. This means that depending
          on how many tokens each word will be split, you will be limited to a certain
          number of words (I would guess probably around 100/200 words).<br>You can
          find models which handle more tokens  but there will always be a limit.<br>So
          yes I would recommend to split your text before. </p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Jean-Baptiste</p>
