        html: '<p>Hello Ashish,</p>

          <p>This is based on Camembert model which is a language model trained specifically
          for french. So performance for English will probably not be good.</p>

          <p>For English you can use model like Bert or Roberta, and train them on
          your entities.  It''s difficult to give you a number of records required
          per entities, sometimes a few hundreds are enough to have correct results.</p>

          <p>Also you can have a look at model already trained for ner for English,
          for instance I trained this one if you want to try it:<br>Jean-Baptiste/roberta-large-ner-english</p>

          <p>But there is plenty of other also available on HF for English.</p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Jean-Baptiste</p>
