        html: '<p>Well I tried it the other day for no reason, really and I tried
          it for roleplaying</p>

          <p>And I was surprised, the way the model generates is quite distinct from
          the others I''ve used before, its prose is good and it certainly provides
          a good response overall</p>

          <p>I could see its being a great model just used for chatting, its good
          at roleplaying but it tends to miss details and sometimes initiate the roleplay
          forward too soon and too fast, but it certainly knows its deal in terms
          of character dialogues and describing their actions and thoughts, I wouldn''t
          say this model is perfect but it certainly has the potential to be something
          more in roleplaying, I hope someone uses this for merge or something</p>

          <p>(And I''ll also have to add it has repetition issues, but I pretty much
          face the same issue on Tiefighter and Echidna and some other 13B Models
          so.. idk really, I still see it a good potential)</p>
