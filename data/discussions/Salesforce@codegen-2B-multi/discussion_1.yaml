          <p>attention scores corresponding to the tokens that are masked out using
          attention_mask get a value of -1e4 as per <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen/blob/main/jaxformer/hf/codegen/modeling_codegen.py#L439">https://github.com/salesforce/CodeGen/blob/main/jaxformer/hf/codegen/modeling_codegen.py#L439</a>,
          whereas the attention scores masked out using causal_mask get a value of
          -1*1e9. This leads to a discrepancy between the pre-softmax attention scores
          for causally masked tokens and padded tokens to be different. This causes
          inference outputs from individual sequences to inference outputs to be different.</p>
