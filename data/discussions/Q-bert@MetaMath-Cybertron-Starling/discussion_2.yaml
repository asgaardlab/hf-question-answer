        html: '<p>Each of the over 20 Mistrals I''ve tested had notable blind spots,
          and all the Mergers often had odd outputs.</p>

          <p>This one not only scored higher than any other in my person testing,
          but didn''t score low in any area.</p>

          <p>It kinda makes sense since Starling is not very bright, but is unusually
          good at giving human aligned responses, while the other two are unusually
          smart, good at math... So it makes sense they would compliment each other
          well.</p>

          <p>Again, great job!</p>
