        html: '<p>I am currently implementing the Table Transformer and would like
          to further improve the model fine tuned to my data.</p>

          <p>Is there a possibility to tune hyperparameters? If so, which ones are
          particularly relevant here?</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, there is very little information about hyperparameter
          tuning around DETR, many publications only refer to BERT. Can mentioned
          BERT information be used also in DETR?</p>

          <p>Thanks and have a nice day.</p>
