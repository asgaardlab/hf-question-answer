        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Can we do any preprocessing to obtain better detection results? In my
          case, I got full-page tables with alternating color rows (i.e. background
          for the first row is white, the second row is light yellow, the third is
          white again, and so on. </p>

          <p>The table transformer detector is not able to detect these tables. It
          works beautifully on regular tables that are homogenous in terms of background
          and are not full-page.</p>

          <p>I''ve tried  padding the corners of my images, but that doesn''t work.</p>
