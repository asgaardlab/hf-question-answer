        html: '<p>I was met with this when I tried running replit-code-v1-3b via the
          Inference API:</p>

          <p>Loading replit/replit-code-v1-3b requires you to execute the configuration
          file in that repo on your local machine. Make sure you have read the code
          there to avoid malicious use, then set the option <code>trust_remote_code=True</code>
          to remove this error.</p>

          <p>I was wondering if/why it would be necessary to do anything locally ,
          haven''t had to do that for any other models like Google''s flan-t5-xxl.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
