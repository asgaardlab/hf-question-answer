        html: '<p>Hello there, I have a question. Are Replit Ghostwriter and this
          replit-code-v1-3b the same model? If not, then what are the differences?
          Asking because I''ve heard of Replit Ghostwriter before, which is an AI
          that autocompletes your code, and I think the code model from here is also
          a model for code completion. Please forgive me if I asked something that
          is probably stupid, but I am just curious.</p>
