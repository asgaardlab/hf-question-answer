        html: '<p>It mentions in the paper that you randomly selected sequences for
          the test dataset. Shouldn''t we consider something like sequence similarity
          and also make sure there are no sequences in the test dataset that are also
          in the training dataset to prevent data leakage? I was thinking perhaps
          clustering protein-protein complexes using a protein language model might
          be helpful in this regard. Also, do you have code released for how you trained
          the model? I would like to try to replicate what you have done and perhaps
          also use a different train/test split. </p>

          <p>There is a section in the discussion about how trimming for similarity
          reduces the dataset size a lot. There have been some recent efforts to accommodate
          this by making new datasets from scratch with different strategies. <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571298v1">https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2023.12.12.571298v1</a></p>

          <p>I think your idea is a useful one for sure. We have some larger nonredundant
          datasets compiled from STRING, Biogrid, Intact, etc. where we did something
          similar.</p>

          <p>We aren''t releasing the training details of SYNTERACT until we submit
          it for peer review: we are waiting on experimental validation with collaborators.
          SYNTERACT 2.0 preprint will be out within the year, and we plan on operating
          more open source in that effort.</p>
