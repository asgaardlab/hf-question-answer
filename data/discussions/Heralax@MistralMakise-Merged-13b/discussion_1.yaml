        html: '<p>Thank you for liking the model! As for your question, in a way,it''s  both.
          I created this model by finetuning the ReMM Mistral model made by Undi95
          on one of my own datasets; and ReMM mistral is a model created by "merging"
          different Llama2 and Mistral models.  So... it''s a hybrid, sorta. Parts
          of it are Llama, parts of it are Mistral.</p>

          <p>Hope that clears things up a bit. Honestly, it''s surprising that two
          differently pretrained models can by merged and still be coherent, but Undi
          still manages to pull it off time and again.</p>
