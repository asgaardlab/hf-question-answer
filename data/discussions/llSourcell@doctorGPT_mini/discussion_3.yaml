        html: '<p>ok great points everyone. i''m going to add a clear disclaimer to
          the model card, and in the app once its in production letting everyone know
          to not take this advice seriously. there are too many potential liabilities
          right now. the goal is to constantly develop this technology to a point
          where that disclaimer is not needed in the next few months or years. today
          it is and i am happy to cooperate. thanks! </p>
