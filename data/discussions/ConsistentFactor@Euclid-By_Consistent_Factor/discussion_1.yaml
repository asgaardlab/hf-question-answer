        html: '<p>Hi,<br>first - thank you very much for your work.<br>Hope it is
          okay, to start here a disussion / feedback.</p>

          <p>My daily runner is the V55 since his release and i tested the V6 now
          many hours and<br>couldn get this realism as there was since your famous
          Euclid V5.0.</p>

          <p>The skin texture and skin color on the V6 is (on my setup) very "render-ish".
          It is a little<br>better with your recommended Heun Sampler, but Heun is
          also a very "expensive" Sampler,<br>as it needs 2-3 the sample / diffusion
          time, also with lowered Steps. </p>

          <p>V5.5 - out of the box - no VAE added - with many different samplers has
          a very realistic skin color<br>(red-elements on faces or knees etc.) and
          the wrinkles, skin texture can easy prompt in ..<br>My main issues are often
          the teeths, and on 5.1 there were some nose-ring issues. These are<br>much
          better on V5.5</p>

          <p>May you have a final idea how to get (easy - also with Karras samplers)
          the nice skin colors / texture<br>back.</p>

          <p>Again, thank you for your work</p>

        html: '<p>Hi ConsistentFactor,</p>

          <p>thank you for your answer and the option to send you a Prompt-Set. As
          those prompts<br>are actually "not for public" (...  4+ months of development
          and optimization - the<br>goal is to work with lower than 75 pos / 75 neg
          prompts and no Extra-VAE, Lora, TI, etc. with<br>absolut reality (sfw &amp;
          nsfw) and full control of 12+ content-rules , in a runtime under<br>1 sec.
          / img on 4090s), i tried to find  any possibility to send  those per DM.
          But i couldnt<br>find here or in civtai any DM options. May you have a Discord
          or a other DM option?</p>

          <p>After some re-work and much more testing on the V6 my results are nearly
          perfect.<br>The mayor culprit was my longtime used "semirealistic" as the
          first prompt inside my<br>negative chain. It really needs that "unrealistic"
          (as in your examples written) prompt (best on first place)<br>to diffuse
          the right direction.Also my "background and lighting" prompts should be
          on the (nearly)<br>last position in the positive prompts, to keep a consistent
          saturation in batch-runs. .. </p>

          <p>I also get more friendship with the Heun Sampler. Lowering to 18-20 and
          little uplift of the cfg around 9 - 9.5<br>is enough and okay from the speed.</p>

          <p>A nice Sampler, on lowerg cfg (7) and lower Sample Steps (20) is the
          DPM++ 2M SDE  (not Karras)<br>It brings on those low - and very fast runs
          - some nice structure and grain to my results.<br>DDIM brings on Stepsizes
          around 10 great results. ( all tests are done without attention optimzations
          / xformers).</p>

          <p>My Sampler summary:</p>

          <p>(F -&gt; Fast , S -&gt; Slow, * = best results (subjectiv) )</p>

    handle is ConsistentFactor444#2108


    With regards to sampler testing I will do some more in depth testing. Will definitely
    try "Lowering to 18-20 and little uplift of the cfg around 9 - 9.5

    is enough and okay from the speed."


    Would help me as Heun only gets around 2it/s and then 2s/it on hi-res fix, at
    least on my hardware.'
