        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>If you wish to do that, you will have to modify the interfaces.py directly.
          You can really override the interface class and do whatever. I guess that
          in your case, you can just copy and past the code of this interface and
          add some .train() somewhere.</p>
