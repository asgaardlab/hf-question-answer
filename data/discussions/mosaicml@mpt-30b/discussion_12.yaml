        html: '<p>I am interested in using the models stemming from the MPT base model.
          I see a fairly deep dive into the sources used to train the model, but after
          digging a couple of layers it is not easy to be certain that the source
          data is free from copyright/licensing issues if I were to use this model.
          I.e. what prevents someone from suing for infringement. Is there a clear
          attribution statement bubbled up from all source repos that the training
          data was all permissively licensed for commercial use and related? Thanks!</p>
