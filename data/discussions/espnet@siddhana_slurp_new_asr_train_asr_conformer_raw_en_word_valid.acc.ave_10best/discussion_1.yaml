          <p>The model has been trained on SLU dataset SLURP (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13205">https://arxiv.org/abs/2011.13205</a>).
          The dataset has 18 scenarios (like weather in the given example) and 46
          actions (like query in the given example). Kindly refer to the dataset repo
          (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/pswietojanski/slurp">https://github.com/pswietojanski/slurp</a>)
          to know the exact tags the model has been trained on. </p>

          <p>The model is then trained using an auxiliary ASR objective by making
          the model first generate intent followed by ASR transcript. Please refer
          to our paper(<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14706">https://arxiv.org/abs/2111.14706</a>)
