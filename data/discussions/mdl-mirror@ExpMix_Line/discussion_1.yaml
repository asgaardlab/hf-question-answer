          and that license does not prohibit it on being used for commercial usage,
          I just followed your license there and applied it here in this repository.</p>

          <p>This model is downloaded several thousand times already and taking this
          down will just encourage more people to re-upload this model.</p>

          <p>Also, I saw that this model have been mixed in to other models, will
          you also hunt them down? I don''t want to sound rude but since this model
          is also based off mixes from other <strong>free</strong> models, you can''t
          really enforce this. This is just a convoluted cat and mouse scenario.</p>

          mine):</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>The Stable Diffusion model is created by a collaboration between engineers
          and researchers from CompVis, Stability AI, and LAION and released under
          a Creative ML OpenRAIL-M license, which means that it <strong>can be used
          for commercial and non-commercial purposes</strong>. <small> <a rel="nofollow"

          </blockquote>

          <p>The people who use this model will be the ones solely responsible to
          their generations. </p>

          <p>I disagree on your action on taking this down.</p>

          <p>I added a disclaimer that commercial use is prohibited to the model card.</p>
