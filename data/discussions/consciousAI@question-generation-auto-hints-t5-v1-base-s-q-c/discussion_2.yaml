        html: '<p>Hey everyone,</p>

          <p>I''ve been working on deploying a question generate model from Hugging
          Face, and I''m encountering a bit of an issue when using it in Google Colab.
          In a live environment, the model performs well, generating questions related
          to my text with the hints I provide. However, Google Colab, it seems to
          generate only one type of question, which is always in the format of "Is
          it true that...?"</p>

          <p>I''d really appreciate some guidance on how to make the "Multi-Task Model(s)
          Sensitive to Hints" work smoothly in Google Colab. I suspect there might
          be some differences in the environment or how hints are being interpreted.</p>

          <p>If anyone has experience with this or can offer suggestions on hint placement,
          prompt structure, or any other relevant tips, I''d be grateful for your
          insights. I''m eager to make this model work effectively in Colab for my
          project.</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance for your help!</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Samane</p>
