        html: '<p>Hey guys, </p>

          <p>first of all thank you very much for uploading the quantized model.  Is
          there any option to release how you quantized the model?<br>I assume it
          is with autogptq, but i got problems quantizing the model even with the
          text-generation-server quantize cli. </p>

          <p>That would be very great!   </p>
