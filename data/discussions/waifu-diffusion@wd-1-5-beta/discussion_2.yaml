        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>I''m just wondering if there are any general discoveries regarding training
          that the creators are willing to share? e.g. Does caption dropout seem to
          help? Did you settle on randomizing all tags or sometimes leave some at
          the front? (e.g. 1man, 1woman, etc)</p>
