        html: '<p>How cherry-picked are the examples in the "<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cafeai.notion.site/WD-1-5-Beta-2-Release-Notes-2852db5a9cdd456ba52fc5730b91acfd">Release
          Notes</a>"? Can you provide me all the generation hyperparameters, including
          the seed? Thanks.</p>

          <p>I used the exact same prompt, that was provided in the example</p>

          <pre><code>Positive:

          1girl, aqua eyes, baseball cap, blonde hair, closed mouth, earrings, green
          background, hat, hoop earrings, jewelry, looking at viewer, shirt, short
          hair, simple background, solo, upper body, yellow shirt,

          (waifu, anime, exceptional, best aesthetic, new, newest, best quality, masterpiece,
          extremely detailed:1.2)

          Negative:

          lowres, ((bad anatomy)), ((bad hands)), text, missing finger, extra digits,
          fewer digits, blurry, ((mutated hands and fingers)), (poorly drawn face),
          ((mutation)), ((deformed face)), (ugly), ((bad proportions)), ((extra limbs)),
          extra face, (double head), (extra head), ((extra feet)), monster, logo,
          cropped, worst quality, jpeg, humpbacked, long body, long neck, ((jpeg artifacts)),
          deleted, old, oldest, ((censored)), ((bad aesthetic)), (mosaic censoring,
          bar censor, blur censor)

          </code></pre>

          <p>I tried <code>Euler</code>, <code>Euler a</code> and <code>DPM++ 2M</code>
          with maximum number of steps. I tried adding the wdgoodprompt/wdbadprompt
          embeddings. I tried different CFG Scales. I tried starting with 384x512
          and then Latent Higres. fix to 768x1024 with different Denoising strengths.
          I tried with and without CLIP skip.</p>

          <p>I am using the <code>kl-f8-anime2.ckpt</code> VAE (I even manually force
          selected it in the settings). I am on the latest version of <code>stable-diffusion-webui</code>
          at the moment (commit <code>b08500ce</code>, v1.2.0).</p>

          <p>What am I doing wrong?</p>
