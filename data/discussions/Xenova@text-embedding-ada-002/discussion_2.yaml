        html: '<p>Hi there - this warning message is printed because transformers
          does not support the <code>GPT4Tokenizer</code> class (since GPT4 isn''t
          open source and hence not supported in the library). Fortunately, the <code>GPT4Tokenizer</code>
          and <code>GPT2Tokenizer</code> are extremely similar, only differing by
          vocabulary and a few settings (like pre-tokenization split regex). For this
          reason, we can just load the tokenizer.json with <code>GPT2Tokenizer</code>
