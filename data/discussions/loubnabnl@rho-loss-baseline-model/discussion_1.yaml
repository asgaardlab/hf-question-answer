        html: '<p>Hello. Since this paper came out I''ve wanted to implement this
          and I thought I would make a contribution to HF this way but I see you already
          got started on this. However I can''t see that you have a working model.
          Can you clarify the current status on this project and what the best way
          I can contribute here might be? Thank you and I''m sorry if this is not
          the most appropriate way to have this conversation!</p>
