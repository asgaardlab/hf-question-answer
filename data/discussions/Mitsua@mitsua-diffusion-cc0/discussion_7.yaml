        html: '<p>I still have a lot to learn about AI, so please correct if I''m
          wrong. As far as I know controlNet was designed for stable diffusion only;
          I tried to install it on Automatic1111 with mitsua and got several errors.
          Is there any similar extension or a way to install controlNet with mitsua?
          </p>

          <p>Thanks you!</p>
