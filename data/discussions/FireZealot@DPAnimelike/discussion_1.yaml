        html: '<p>Hi, I noticed you posted an experimental merged model that incorporates
          Animelike2.5D. I was hoping to experiment with Animelike2.5D on my own,
          but it seems to have been taken down everywhere. If you still have the base
          model Animelike2.5D and would be willing to share it privately with me for
          noncommercial research purposes, I would greatly appreciate it. If not,
          no problem, I understand. In any case, thanks for your contributions to
          the community!</p>
