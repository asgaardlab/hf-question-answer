        html: '<p>ok im new to the community and have been using your models exlusively
          thus far, but you never give what each model is good at or prompt info.
          i would be nice to have a warning like on open hermes that they would be
          wordy, and do everything in its power to lecture me every chance it gets.
          however like i said im new to the community so first thank you for your
          hard work thus far.</p>
