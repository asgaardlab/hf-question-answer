        html: '<p>Hi</p>

          <p>Did the developers change the output class label from ''Positive'' to
          ''positive'' and ''Negative'' to ''negative''?</p>

          <p>I had my pipeline setup and it was working perfectly the past 5 months,
          but since 28th Nov it started giving an error. Turns out that now the label
          is all lowercase.</p>

          <p>Am I picking the right issue here? </p>
