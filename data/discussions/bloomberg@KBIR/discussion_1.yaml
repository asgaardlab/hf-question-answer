        html: '<p>Hi! Ujjwal, Thanks for your interest.  In order to extract keyphrases
          using the KBIR model, you can actually use it after finetuning. There are
          others who have finetuned the model on different datasets and made it available
          in Huggingface. Here are some of them:</p>

          </ol>

          <p>You can find elaborate instructions in each of these model cards. Essentially,
          finetuning <code>KBIR</code>  will be similar to finetuning <code>RoBERTa</code>
          as it is built on top of it.</p>

          <p>Another interesting piece of code is - <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/ml6team/keyphrase-extraction/blob/main/pipelines/keyphrase_extraction_pipeline.py">https://huggingface.co/spaces/ml6team/keyphrase-extraction/blob/main/pipelines/keyphrase_extraction_pipeline.py</a><br>which
          should help you to use the Huggingface pipeline code.</p>

          <p> You can also use other existing libraries like Flair NLP  and simpletransformers
          to point to the huggingface model id and use their tools to finetune it</p>
