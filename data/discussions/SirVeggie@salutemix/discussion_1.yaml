        html: '<p>Adding weight to negatives, especially strong embeds like easynegative,
          can easily diminish the expressiveness of the model and introduce artifacts
          so it is usually a good idea to do "just enough". Also I recommend trying
          to put terms and tags into the negative prompt that you wouldn''t normally
          think of using there, like words that you would usually associate with good
          things, as it can lead to more interesting results. For a quick example:
          ''trending on artstation'' or ''unreal engine''. Often when trying to make
          more unique images the negative prompt consists of two parts; ''style direction''
          like <code>(3d, unreal engine:1.2)</code> and a generic quality enhancer
          like <code>(worst quality:1.5), easynegative</code> as the second part.
          Using certain painting styles or artist names is also interesting to consider
          for the ''style direction'' part. Example: <code>(intricate, monochrome,
          sketch, realistic, 3d:1.3), (low quality:1.5), (easynegative:0.9)</code></p>

          <p>Perhaps this helps a little with coming up with interesting negatives
          ^^</p>
