        html: '<p>I believe this instruct version was not trained on a dataset with
          examples of "system" messages. I recommend putting the system message right
          after your instruction, so for example: <code>&lt;s&gt; [INST] Hello, how
          are you? Respond like a pirate. [/INST]</code></p>

          <p>Here, <code>Hello, how are you?</code> is the instruction, and <code>Respond
          like a pirate.</code> is the system prompt.</p>

          <p>Feel free to experiment and try different approaches. If you''d really
          need a system message, you would probably have to fine-tune this further
          on your own dataset.</p>
