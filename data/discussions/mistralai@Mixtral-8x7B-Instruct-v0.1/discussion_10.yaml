          the scenes, but openchat has been acting schizophrenic since mixtral was
          released. It just goes on rambling sentences it didn''t used to now, listing
          adjectives and synonyms for hundreds of tokens for no reason.</p>

          <p>Why can''t we just have a good working openchat that''s unaffected by
