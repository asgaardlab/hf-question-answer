        html: '<p>Hello,<br>My question is, I am applying a model SFT to chat data.
          I do this with the LLama-7b&amp;13b-Chat-hf and Mistral-Instruction_V_2.0
          models.</p>

          <p>But my question is, should we make this type of chat format SFT or should
          we apply DPO or RHLF directly?</p>

          <p>I apply LORA (for SFT).</p>

          <p>I observed that when I perform SFT with Lllama, the model loses its structure
          slightly, but it can also answer other questions other than data.</p>

          <p>But when I do this on Mistral, it loses its entire structure and cannot
          answer any questions other than data.</p>

          <p>What''s the problem with this? What path should we follow? Isn''t SFT
          suitable?<br>Do we need to do DPO or RHLF directly? Topics I really don''t
          understand. Where am I doing wrong?</p>

          <p>Also;<br>I am doing these operations by going over ready-made coding
          such as SFTrainer and DeepSpeedChat, but what should be the difference?
          How can I continue without destroying the structure?</p>

          <p>Caution: You can pay attention to BOS and EOS.</p>

          <p>The format is the same as this example;</p>

          <p>Llama Example:<br>-- &gt; [INST] hello [/INST] how can i help you [INST]
          .... [/INST] ....</p>

          <p>Mistral Example:<br>--&gt; [INST] hello [/INST] how can i help you [INST]
          .... [/INST] ....</p>
