          could be bcz the dataset I put together is really clean; it had no bg noise
          or any other voices and it was of good quality. The dataset is always the

          <p>Just wondering about "no bg noise", are you just manually filter out
          audio with bg noise from dataset or you use some tools to remove the bg
          noise</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>

        html: '<p>It''s a bit of both actually, tools like uvr or other vocal separators
          do most of the job for you but sometimes it doesn''t get rid of all foreign

          noise without editing the audio too much. My rule of thumb is quality &gt;&gt;&gt;
