        html: '<p>Hi, I trained my own model successfully and it worked out fine,
          but I have a question on the training process. I notice that the program
          (Colab code) actually starts to delete many different paths from one point
          (after it uploads some certain paths). I wonder what it is exactly doing.
          Do we need this process of deleting paths if we just want a sovits model?
          Thank you in advance!</p>
