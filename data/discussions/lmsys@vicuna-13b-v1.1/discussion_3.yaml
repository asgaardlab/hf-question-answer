          take a look at https://huggingface.co/reeducator/vicuna-13b-free as there''s
          an unfiltered model there, but it''s based on V3 of the dataset.


          There''s been talk about V4 so I''d suggest TheBloke waits for the updated
          dataset if going to train a new "free" model.'
