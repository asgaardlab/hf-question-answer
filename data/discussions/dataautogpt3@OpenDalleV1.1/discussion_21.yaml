          <p>Avoid the CUDA stuff as thats NVIDIA frameworks.  Ive also switched to
          using Conda for my python environments.   Although occasionally I still
          have to drop into pip/3 to get things behaving.   It''s a fiddly bizness
          getting this stuff to work outside of the NVIDIA/CUDA pathways, but it is
