          <p>I highly recommend looking up "ComfyUI" and experimenting with it, specially
          when you are still learning and on first contacts. </p>

          <p>Its much easier to prototype and experiment and do cool stuff with many
          different models in it, </p>

          <p>then if you have a specific product idea or script/code idea, that''s
          when you use python and diffusers library directly to build your specific
          use case.</p>
