        html: "<p>How to Install GPT4All<br>GPT4All is basically like running ChatGPT\
          \ on your own hardware, and it can give some pretty great answers (similar\
          \ to GPT3 and GPT3.5). Setting it up, however, can be a bit of a challenge\
          \ for some people, especially if you\u2019ve never used GitHub or open-source\
          \ tools before. In this short guide, we\u2019ll break down each step and\
          \ give you all you need to get GPT4All up and running on your own system.</p>\n\
          <p>Note: This guide will install GPT4All for your CPU, there is a method\
          \ to utilize your GPU instead but currently it\u2019s not worth it unless\
          \ you have an extremely powerful GPU with over 24GB VRAM. If you still want\
          \ to see the instructions for running GPT4All from your GPU instead, check\
          \ out this snippet from the GitHub repository.</p>\n<p>Update: There is\
          \ now a much easier way to install GPT4All on Windows, Mac, and Linux! The\
          \ GPT4All developers have created an official site and official downloadable\
          \ installers for each OS. You can visit the official GPT4All website here:\
          \ (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://gpt4all.io/index.html\">https://gpt4all.io/index.html</a>).</p>\n\
          <p>Step 1: Clone the Repository<br>Clone the GPT4All repository to your\
          \ local machine using Git, we recommend cloning it to a new folder called\
          \ \u201CGPT4All\u201D. Open your terminal or command prompt and run the\
          \ following command:</p>\n<p>git clone <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all.git\"\
          >https://github.com/nomic-ai/gpt4all.git</a><br>This will create a local\
          \ copy of the GPT4All repository on your machine.</p>\n<p>Step 2: Download\
          \ the Model Checkpoint<br>The next step is to download the GPT4All CPU quantized\
          \ model checkpoint. Here is a direct link </p>\n<p>Direct download: <a rel=\"\
          nofollow\" href=\"https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin\"\
          >https://the-eye.eu/public/AI/models/nomic-ai/gpt4all/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin</a><br>or<br><a\

          >https://huggingface.co/aryan1107/gpt4all-llora/resolve/main/gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin</a></p>\n\
          <p>Once the download is complete, move the gpt4all-lora-quantized.bin file\
          \ to the \u201Cchat\u201D folder in the cloned repository from earlier.</p>\n\
          <p>Step 3: Navigate to the Chat Folder<br>Navigate to the chat folder inside\
          \ the cloned repository using the terminal or command prompt. You can do\
          \ this by running the following command:</p>\n<p>cd gpt4all/chat<br>This\
          \ will take you to the chat folder. Alternatively, if you\u2019re on Windows\
          \ you can navigate directly to the folder by right-clicking with the Windows\
          \ key held down and selecting \u201COpen PowerShell window here\u201D.</p>\n\
          <p>Step 4: Run the Model<br>Once you are in the chat folder, run the appropriate\
          \ command for your operating system. Here are the commands for different\
          \ operating systems:</p>\n<p>Windows (PowerShell):<br>./gpt4all-lora-quantized-win64.exe<br>M1\
          \ Mac/OSX:<br>./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-m1<br>Linux:<br>./gpt4all-lora-quantized-linux-x86<br>Intel\
          \ Mac/OSX:<br>./gpt4all-lora-quantized-OSX-intel</p>\n<p>This will start\
          \ the GPT4All model, and you can now use it to generate text by interacting\
          \ with it through your terminal or command prompt. Similar to ChatGPT, you\
          \ simply enter in text queries and wait for a response. It may be a bit\
          \ slower than ChatGPT depending on your CPU, but the main difference is\
          \ that there are no limits or network problems to worry about since it\u2019\
          s running on your own hardware.</p>\n<p>Congratulations! You have successfully\
          \ installed and run the CPU quantized version of the GPT4All model checkpoint\
          \ on your local machine. GPT4All is still in early development and is constantly\
          \ improving, so be sure to keep your install up to date. You can easily\
          \ update the repository at any time by navigating to your main install folder\
          \ and running \"Git pull\".</p>\n<p>Source:<br><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"\
