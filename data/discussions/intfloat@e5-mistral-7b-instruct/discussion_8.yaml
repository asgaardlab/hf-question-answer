        html: '<p> thanks for your work; the results in downstream applications have
          been truly excellent. </p>

          <p>In your paper, you mentioned that you designed two separate prompt templates
          for each scenario concerning monolingual semantic textual similarity (STS)
          tasks and bitext retrieval tasks. However, the paper does not explicitly
          detail how these two prompts were formulated. Could you kindly provide complete
          examples for these prompts, similar to what was done for the retrieval task?</p>
