          <p>In the paper (table 2) you reported a nice F1 score of 0.8701, and it
          was also mentioned that the training was done on NEMO corpus.<br>was there
          any changes in this since the paper publication?  (Im asking because i was
          on whatsapp giving credit to NEMO for providing over 90% of the training
          data - is there more that you are able to share?)</p>
