        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thank you for sharing this model! I have been playing with it and noticed
          that in your "prepare_answering_input" function you have swapped context
          with question. After putting the context first and question second (which
          is the way you describe it in text) the probability distribution improved
          significantly to 0.99 for the correct option.</p>

          <p>Just wanted to point it out so that your docs are correct.</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Jakub</p>
