          <p>First of all, thanks for your efforts. It''s great to see a focus on
          non-English languages! Second, you write that your models are the frist
          German-focused, commercially available models. However, the chat and instruction
          datasets that you trained on were translated with OpenAI services and they
          explicitly forbid that models trained with the output of their own models
          be used for commercial reasons.</p>

          <p>So could you clarify what you meant? As far as I can tell your base models
          can be commercially licensed, but the chat models cannot.</p>

          <p>Adding an explicit license would be very helpful! </p>

          <p>LAION does not believe that any AI model''s output can be protected commercially
          and we therefore see no problem with releasing the models under the Llama-2
          community license.</p>

          <p>Aside from this, we do not recommend using the chat models in any production
          setting without further validation or more explicit, task-specific finetuning.
          While the chat models are a good baseline and serve their purpose of demonstrating
          the efficacy of our continued pretraining approach, they are not reliable
          enough as-is for any production environment and tend to hallucinate. Finding
          and creating better finetuning datasets (perhaps without the use of OpenAI)
          is up to the community. Our base models are there to accelerate this development
          and make German finetuning easier for the open-source and commercial community.</p>
