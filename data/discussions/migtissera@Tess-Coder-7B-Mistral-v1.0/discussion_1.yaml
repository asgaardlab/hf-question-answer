        html: '<p>HI!</p>

          <p>If it''s not too much to ask, I''m interested in your training process
          besides the dataset. (ex: lora/qlora, full fine tuning, anything unusual
          during training a.s.o.)<br>I feel that also brings a lot of value, kind
          of like what you did with Tess, posting the learnings from training it.</p>

          <p>Thank you!</p>
