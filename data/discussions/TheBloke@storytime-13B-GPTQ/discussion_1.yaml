          my honest opinion, this might be the best model i have seen for roleplay.
          The characters all understand the context, can talk like how they are supposed
          to based on their character card and it almost never gets hallucinations
          or gets out of track with the roleplay. This is so far my favorite model
          right now and i have been using it constantly and it never disappoints for

          <p>Oh brilliant! I''ll check them out, heard about sicilicon maid and I

          is there any good 13B models you checked out too?</p>

          <p>I used to have more 13B models but as of right now i guess the best 13B
          models i have are Noromaid-13B (Both V1.1 and V2) and OrcaMaid-13B. Tbh
          i used to have way more 13B models but lately i''ve been finding many 7B
          models that outperform the majority of 13B models i have tried. </p>

          <p>These are the current models i have right now:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/62a027239c6a6eb5d6216dfc/8rgWkdYwf8tJ2VkiTZTz3.png"><img

          <p>I actually never used the V2 since I haven''t heard about it before,
          asl well as orcamaid. I''ll be limited test them to see if they are my style,
