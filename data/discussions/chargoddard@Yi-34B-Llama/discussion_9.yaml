          <p>I was wondering, why isn''t llama-tokenizer branch the main branch? Is
          there some risk I should be aware of?</p>

          <p>When I originally posted this I wasn''t 100% sure I got the tokenizer
          converted correctly. I put it on a branch so it could be submitted to the
          HF leaderboard and evaluated, but left the main branch as is because it
          was a known working configuration.</p>

          <p>I''m now quite confident in the llama-tokenizer branch. It could be moved
          over to main for sure. But 01-ai now have their official repos llamaized,
          so there isn''t much reason to be using this one anymore - I figured I would
          leave it as is, as a historical curiosity.</p>
