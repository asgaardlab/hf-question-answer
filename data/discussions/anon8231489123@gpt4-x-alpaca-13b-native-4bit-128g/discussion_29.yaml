          <p>being new to the whole topic i thought to give it a go with this model,
          but encountered an error which i am unable to solve.<br>Using oobabooga
          i am able to run the provided default models without issues and with appropriate
          responses. </p>

          <p>This model also boots up without any (shown) issues in the console:<br><a

          the output is complete garbage and looks like this: </p>

          <p>I appended the following parameters to the server.py in start-webui.bat
          for this specific model, the default models obviously won''t start with
          these settings:<br><code> server.py --chat --auto-devices --wbits 4 --groupsize
          128 --verbose </code></p>

          <p>Not using wbits and groupsize results in errors starting this model,
          which is to be expected.<br>I did notice that the VRAM usage instantly drops
          from 4G to around 350M after entering any prompt.</p>

          <p>Can anyone point me in a direction of what this may be caused by?<br>Thanks
          in advance!</p>

        html: '<p>I was having the same issue as you. I was able to get it working
          by forcing it to use the cuda model. </p>

          <p>Your screen shot it''s loading the non cuda model pt file.</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/631f5b085172252802e5cd3e/sEleq-0Ipkz5Bua4UeAnz.png"><img

          <p>I was able to fix it by renaming the pt file without -cuda at the end
          to .pt.bkup so it wouldn''t pick it up and instead load the correct model
          file.  while keeping the other model just in case.</p>
