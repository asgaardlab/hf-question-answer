        html: '<p>As many other people I got this error too. Im runnig an rtx 3060
          12gb + Ryzen 9 12 cores + 16gb ram<br>I tried every single parameter in
          webui.bat but nothing helped. Today I figured out that just setting  the
          virtual memory of the HDD where you have oobabooga installed fixes the issue.
          You need to check the "System managed size" box and thats all.<br>It fixed
          the error for me and now Im able to start the webui. It takes around 127-200
          seconds to load the model itself.<br>The only issue now is that, even tho
          the responses are very fast (it takes around 4-6 seconds to generate a whole
          phrase) they dont make any sense.<br>For example if I ask the AI to give
          me information about Coca-Cola brand, it says stuff like "we are sorry that
          you are having issues, please call this number (800)XXX-XXX-XXX -Alex"<br>It
          doesent matter what GUI model you choose, it will most likely ignore what
          you asked and say stuff on its own.<br>I managed to fix that too by using
          --pre_layer 35 in the webui.bat but that only makes the responses extremely
          slow and they dont really make any sense either<br>If someone manages to
          make this thing work it will be higly appreciated</p>
