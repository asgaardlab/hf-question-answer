        html: '<p>compared to the vicuna model, this one seems pretty dumb. I tried
          asking it when was its training ended and it keeps giving hypothetical or

          2021.<br>Vicuna model can also give me a list of adjectives, but this model
          gives me a weird answer every time. LMAO</p>
