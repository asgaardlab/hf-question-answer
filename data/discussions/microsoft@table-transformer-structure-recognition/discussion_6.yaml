          <ul>

          <li>This IS expected if you are initializing TableTransformerForObjectDetection
          from the checkpoint of a model trained on another task or with another architecture
          (e.g. initializing a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForPreTraining
          model).</li>

          <li>This IS NOT expected if you are initializing TableTransformerForObjectDetection
          from the checkpoint of a model that you expect to be exactly identical (initializing
          a BertForSequenceClassification model from a BertForSequenceClassification
          model).</li>
