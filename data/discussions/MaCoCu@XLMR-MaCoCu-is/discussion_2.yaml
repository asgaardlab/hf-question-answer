        html: '<p>Just wanted to ask, if there are any plans to update the model with
          more text resources ?</p>

          <p>The Icelandic government funded SIM project has created a large amount
          of language resources that could be used to improve the model even further:</p>

          <p>These Icelandic text resources are available at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://clarin.is/en/resources">https://clarin.is/en/resources</a></p>

          <p>E.g. text corpora, notably from a size POV:</p>

          <pre><code>Icelandic Gigaword Corpus (IGC, 8,2GB)

          Icelandic Common Crawl Corpus ( ICC, 4,9GB)

          </code></pre>

          <p>Maybe you could consider adding these resources for a future update of
          the model ?</p>
