        html: '<p>Folks: Any benchmarks on performance of Falcon-7B.  </p>

          <p>We have a fine-tuned model that does about 25 tokens per second on a
          A10 GPU + 24GB VRAM + 4CPU + 16 GB RAM.<br>This seems quite expensive and
          bloody slow to run.  Any others have insights on what kind of performance
          to expect?</p>

          <p>We are upgrading it to 16cpus+ 64GB RAM  and testing on A100 also.  Will
          share those results </p>
