        html: '<p>Hello, first time user here</p>

          <p>So ,following the starter code in the description , i seemed to have
          run into quite a few errors, although after installing <code>accelerate
          ,einops and transformers</code> as the errors suggested, I ended up with
          this new error statement after the weights have been downloaded (I''m working
          on colab btw)</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6308aa7d5f244674f7974cc2/1mQwbWOETwcWirfs0wmDt.png"><img

          Would appreciate any help on my error</p>
