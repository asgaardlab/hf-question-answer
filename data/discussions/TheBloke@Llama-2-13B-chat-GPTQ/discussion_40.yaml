        html: '<p>So I am trying to build a chatbot and implement the chat history
          thing as well. But I sometimes receive empty and just blank spaces after
          the whole response. Does this effect eh number of tokens I am giving as
          input for the next query? How do stop the model from generating white spaces.</p>

          <p>Also I am currently just adding the responses using a while loop, is
          there any other way, like a parameter or some kind of a function to do this?</p>
