        html: '<p>Hi Everyone! </p>

          <p>Thanks for including CodeGen in the latest release of HuggingFace transformer
          package. I was curious if you are planning to support <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/auto#transformers.AutoModelForSequenceClassification">AutoModelForSequenceClassification</a>
          HuggingFace API on CodeGen models?</p>

          <p>If yes, do you have a rough timeline on when you might consider implementing
          the support for AutoModelForSequenceClassification?</p>

          <p>I found <a rel="nofollow" href="https://discuss.huggingface.co/t/can-the-salesforce-s-t5-codegen-models-can-be-used-for-classification/20643">another
          discussion</a> on HF forum and tried searching for open PRs/issues on GitHub,
          but did not find any.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
