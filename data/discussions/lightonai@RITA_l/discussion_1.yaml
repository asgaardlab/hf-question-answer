        html: '<p>Dear Authors,</p>

          <p>Thanks for sharing your excellent work. I tried to fine tune RITA using
          Huggingface''s run_clm.py script but got an error of "Loading lightonai/RITA_l
          requires you to execute the configuration file in that repo on your local
          machine. Make sure you have read the code there to avoid malicious use,
          then set the option <code>trust_remote_code=True</code> to remove this error.".  The
          script worked for other models in Huggingface. Any hints/solutions are highly
          appreciated. Thanks.</p>
