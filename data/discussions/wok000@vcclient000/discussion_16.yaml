        html: '<p>Hello, first thank you sooo much for your project!! &lt;3</p>

          <p>My suggestion is as follows:<br>A left and right arrow button for the
          main audio settings (Gain, Tune, INDEX).<br>Often it can be hard to fine
          tune the selection because it relies on the sensitivity of your mouse. If
          you move Tune to say -11 but you need -12, its difficult to get it to the
          exact number easily, but adding buttons to move it over a notch or two would
          completely remove this issue. Thank you for your consideration!</p>
