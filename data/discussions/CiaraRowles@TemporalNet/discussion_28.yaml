        html: '<p>You say "Also, I highly recommend you use this in conjunction with
          the hed model, the settings are already in the script."</p>

          <p>Is all that needs changing is the model on the line controlnet2_path
          = "diffusers/controlnet-canny-sdxl-1.0" ?</p>

          <p>I tried changing it to controlnet2_path = "lllyasviel/sd-controlnet-hed"
          and I now get</p>

          <p>File "D:\controlnet-temporalnet-sdxl-1.0\venv\lib\site-packages\torch\nn\modules\linear.py",
          line 114, in forward<br>    return F.linear(input, self.weight, self.bias)<br>RuntimeError:
          mat1 and mat2 shapes cannot be multiplied (154x2048 and 768x320)</p>

          <p>Which model should I use and are there any other changes needed?</p>

          <p>Using the provided temporalvideo.py with canny gives even more flickering
          output videos with faded out colors.  Is this normal, or is there an updated
          version of the script?  I can upload some examples somewhere if that would
          help.</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
