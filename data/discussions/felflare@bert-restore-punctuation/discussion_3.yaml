          <p>This thing works pretty much perfectly for me. Especially for extremely
          large text files.</p>

          <p>Here''s a Colab notebook I worked up for quick use of rpunct. The referenced
          text is a 2.7mb text file completely in lowercase without punctuation, and
          it only takes about 5 minutes for it to completely repunctuate the entire
          document. See if it works for you : <a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17u5XCLhhY_BCijxpVuZkjzgC9mvl6vXQ?usp=sharing">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/17u5XCLhhY_BCijxpVuZkjzgC9mvl6vXQ?usp=sharing</a></p>
