          1111, ComfyUI works like a dream though. Switched for SDXL usage. I don''t

          <p>Edit: (Might I suggest normalbae or softedge next for training? My SDXL
          animations really need Depth+Normalbae and a softedge outline for stability.
          I''m currently using it but Canny isn''t the best for full outlines as I
          assume its for fine detail, lineart was okay but I always had the best results
          for full outlines with softedge. Thanks for the controlnets!) </p>
