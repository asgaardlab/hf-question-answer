          <p>As the title suggests, I wanted to know if the future RWKV models can
          be integrated with any exisiting application as an assistant to perform
          tasks on own based on the intents it predicts. It should output in a structured
          manner like a JSON like how AutoGPT does where it includes THOUGHTS, REASONING,
          CRITICISM and the ACTION to be performed.</p>

          <p>P.S.  - I am pretty excited about this research and want to know if any
          bigger model is scheduled to come out soon whose performance is comparable
          to commercial models out in the market.</p>
