        html: '<p>Greetings,</p>

          <p>I am training a Dreambooth model on Waifu Diffusion 1.4 and there is
          something weird going on. I would like to see if anyone knows what it could
          be<br>Here: </p>

          <p>The model is trained just fine, it works when generating samples. The
          image above is from the current checkpoint, nothing was changed.<br>But
          then I have to generate the .ckpt file to use on the AUTOMATIC1111 GUI.<br>However,
          if I try to generate the images with the "compiled" ckpt...</p>

          <p>Only garbage comes out with the "ckpt", but the regular Diffusers (non
          ckpt) model works fine<br>Do you have any idea of what could be going on?<br>What
          is the process to generate ckpts with Waifu Diffusion 1.4?</p>

          <p>Thank you</p>
