          ask some questions to clear things up.</p>

          <p>Assuming I re-train it from scratch similarly to a typical BERT model,
          how can I can configure the width/depth weights? </p>

          <p>If I save/load the model, will the configuration for weights percist?</p>

          <p>Are we able to change the weights numerous times in the model object''s
          lifetime, or is it done only once at initialization?</p>

          <p>Is there any specific API calls I need to make after training to generate
          the sub-set models, or are they generated on the fly during training?</p>
