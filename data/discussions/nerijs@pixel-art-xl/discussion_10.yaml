        html: '<p>Hi, I''m using this awesome lora with ComfyUi (found it on yt I
          guess you know which video) and I''m literally loving it.<br> Wanted to
          ask, there''s a way to feed it with examples I provide directly from the
          UI ?  So that I can let it know that I want something similar to my starting
          image</p>

          <p>I could deal also with pytorch code but I need some hint</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
