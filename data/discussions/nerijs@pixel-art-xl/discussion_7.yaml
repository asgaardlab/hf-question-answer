        html: '<p>Hi, the license for this on huggingface seems to differ from the
          permissions you''ve set on civitai. Please clarify if I''m able to use this
          model to output custom avatars with lora weights for a pet social media
          service app. For example on the open rail m license it says "You may host
          for Third Party remote access purposes (e.g. software-as-a-service)" but
          this is not so clear on civitai.. (if we have any revenue through the app
          we would be indirectly "selling" the images from the output of this model)</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
