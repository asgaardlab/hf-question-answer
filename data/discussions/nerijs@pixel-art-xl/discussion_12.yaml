        html: '<p>Thank you for the great model!</p>

          <p>I am trying to extract the rgb colors of each pixel square of the resulting
          image.</p>

          <p>How big are the pixel squares in the generated images?</p>

          <p>It seems to be 8px * 8px, but I am not quite sure.</p>

          <p>Is there a method you would recommend for extracting the rgb colors of
          each pixel square?</p>
