        html: '<p>Hi madhurjindal,<br>I tried to use your code to detect Gibberish,
          but I the output I received seemed strange and I didn''t understand it.
          What I did was the following: </p>

          <ul>

          <li>installed transformers, etc. </li>

          <li>from transformers import AutoModelForSequenceClassification, AutoTokenizer<br>model
          = AutoModelForSequenceClassification.from_pretrained("madhurjindal/autonlp-Gibberish-Detector-492513457")<br>tokenizer
          = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("madhurjindal/autonlp-Gibberish-Detector-492513457")</li>

          <li>inputs = tokenizer("I like apples.", return_tensors="pt")<br>outputs
          = model(**inputs)<br>outputs</li>

          </ul>

          <p>The output is: SequenceClassifierOutput(loss=None, logits=tensor([[ 2.0615,  0.1996,
          -2.1773, -0.5643]], grad_fn=), hidden_states=None, attentions=None)</p>

          <p>Now, if I understood correctly, tensor gives you the weight/number representing
          [clean, mild gibberish, word salad, noise] ? What I don''t understand is
          the meaning of the positive and negative number plus its size. What is more,
          I wanted to ask if with this code one can identify a Gibberish word in a
          sentence, document, instead of getting some general numbers related to the
          full sentence? </p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for you reply.<br>Kind regards,<br>M</p>
