        html: '<p>Yeah I probably should have explained a bit better :p</p>

          <p>Basically, the model would occasionally return empty responses, and/or
          randomly inject special tokens when it should not have (e.g. eos tokens
          after apostraphes).  It didn''t happen very often (&lt;1 % of the time in
          my testing), but it can be annoying.</p>

          <p>I did some evals to test Tim Dettmer''s suggestion to first quantize
          the model, then dequantize it, then merge the lora weights, and it seems
          to have helped with the issue (but in general the llama-2 models seem to
          randomly do this still).</p>

          <p>I just re-uploaded the weights after using that merge technique, and
          am testing it now.</p>
