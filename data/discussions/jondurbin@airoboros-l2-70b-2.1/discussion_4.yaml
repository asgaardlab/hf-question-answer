        html: '<p>The contextual question answering format was added as a way to enhance
          performance of retrieval augmented generation - the idea being you fetch
          one or more context blocks via similarity search (or whatever retrieval
          mechanism), with some metadata (e.g. url/date/author as a source of truth
          mechanism to reference) and the answer should better align with the context.</p>

          <p>The training data includes examples with up to 5 input blocks with one
          or more questions/instructions that make use of 1 or more of the input blocks.  It
          may not be required for question answering, but it does seem to help.  I
