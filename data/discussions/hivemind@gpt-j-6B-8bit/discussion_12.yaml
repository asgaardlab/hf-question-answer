        html: '<p>Hello, firstly thank you for making GPT-J and many other language
          models more accessible!</p>

          <p>I''ve successfully converted GPT-Neo 1.3B model using the notebook you
          linked. But when using the transformers save_pretrained() function, and
          I try to load the model back, it just tells me that the weights are destroyed;
          and when I try to use the model (after reloading from the saved files),
          it is dead.</p>

          <p>So assuming I want train the model in 8-bit with mixed precision using
          your notebook, after the training is done, should I just convert it back
          to 32-bit or what? And if so, what''s the proper way for a reverse_bnbfy?</p>

          <p>Or maybe I can somehow save and load the 8-bit weights back without resorting
          to saving in 32-bit, so can someone guide me how?</p>
