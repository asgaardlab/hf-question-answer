        html: '<p>This discussion was created to request the conversion of the model
          from PyTorch .bin to Tensorflow .h5. </p>

          <p>I would like to convert to TensorFlow format for further analysis and
          use in a TensorFlow-based application. I understand that converting a PyTorch
          model to TensorFlow format can be a challenging task, and it requires a
          thorough understanding of both frameworks. However, I believe that this
          conversion would be beneficial in terms of using the PyTorch model in a
          TensorFlow-based application and to the TensorFlow community.<br>Therefore,
          I kindly request your support in converting the PyTorch model into TensorFlow
          format. I would greatly appreciate your expertise in this matter and any
          guidance you can provide.<br>Thank you for your time and consideration.
          I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>Sincerely,<br>William.</p>
