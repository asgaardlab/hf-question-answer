          <p>I can see some online for other versions of Imagenet, such as the Imagenet
          1,000 dataset, but I think they may have changed - as I''ve checked predictions
          from this against those and they''re all over the place - the example image
          is apparently a weasel and cats come out as monkeys etc.</p>

          <p>This is what I found, but it''s not right: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/">https://deeplearning.cms.waikato.ac.nz/user-guide/class-maps/IMAGENET/</a>
