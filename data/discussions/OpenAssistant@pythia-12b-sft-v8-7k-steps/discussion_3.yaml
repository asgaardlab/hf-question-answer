          it doesn''t support all of them. However, I have used them in my projects
          so far and it has been working well. This is what I''ve done:<br><code>&lt;|system|&gt;</code>
          - Used to let the model know what it is supposed to do. I don''t know if
          you are meant to include the <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code> token afterwards,
          but it seems to be working well for me so far.<br>Ex: <code>&lt;|system|&gt;You
          are an AI that summarizes a conversation in as few words as possible.&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code></p>

          <p><code>&lt;|assistant|&gt;</code> - The basic token letting the model
          know it needs to start acting like the assistant.<br>Ex: <code>&lt;|prompter|&gt;What
          is a meme, and what''s the history behind this word?&lt;|endoftext|&gt;&lt;|assistant|&gt;</code></p>

          GitHub</a>, it isn''t implemented yet. I''ve been using it and it seems
          to be working well so far for me.<br>Ex: <code>&lt;|prefix_begin|&gt;"Rice
          is a common grain found in various cuisines worldwide." "There exist multiple
          types of rices including long grain, medium grain, etcetera." There are

          -&gt; <code>Food and drink&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code></p>

          <p><code>&lt;|prompter|&gt;</code> - I think you can infer the usage based
          on previous examples.<br>Ex: <code>&lt;|prompter|&gt;What is a meme, and
