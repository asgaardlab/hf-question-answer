        html: '<p>Hey Undi95,</p>

          <p>just a short feedback: This model feels surprisingly pleasant. Ok, it
          isn''t as ''intelligent'' as most of your 13B models are, or 20Bs. But for
          a 7B model (q8) it performed pretty impressive in my first easy test, and
          it isn''t stubborn to take corrections. It tends to be a bit repetitive
          in the story line, but this might be my fault, I have to test more. Or let
          me put it the other way round: I''ve seen 13B models performing worse than
          this one.</p>

          <p>I have a request: You put out new models in such a high pace that it
          becomes hard to keep track of what the underlying models capacities are.
          Would you please add a suggestion for the maximum usable context size to
          the model cards? As long as you used llama-2 as base model, we could easily
          use 8k as a very reliable context size. But with your newest merges I have
          lost track of what the models are capable of in terms of context size.</p>

          <p>As always: Thank you for your great effort. I can''t even imagine how
          you do all this that fast.</p>

          <p>Greetings,<br>Huegli</p>
