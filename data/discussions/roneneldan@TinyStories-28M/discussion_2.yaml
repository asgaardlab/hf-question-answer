        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>In the paper (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07759.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.07759.pdf</a>),
          page 3, you give the example of "Lily likes cats and dogs. She asked her
          mom for a dog and her mom said no, so instead she asked" and three answers
          from 2.5M, 33M, 21M models, with the 21M and 33M seemingly replying with
          a sensible answer. I have tried it with your 28M model here, and got "Lily
          likes cats and dogs. She asked her mom for a dog and her mom said no, so
          instead she asked a cat and a dog. They were nice and soft and had a collar.
          Lily was happy and ran to pet them."</p>

          <p>Do you know why this answer isn''t as well thought out as the ones in
          the paper?</p>

          <p>thanks!</p>
