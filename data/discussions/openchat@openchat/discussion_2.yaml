          <p>The code and the weights are separate entities and they come with different
          licenses. Facebook''s LLaMA code is GNU which is open-source, but their
          weights do not have the same license (I''m not sure what the license is
          but it''s not "open"). This means you can use LLaMA code and train your
          own model and release the weights under any license you want. The model
          does not inherit the code''s license and vice-versa. This is how Open LLaMA
          models are really open for both the code and the weights.</p>
