        html: '<p>This is the mistral mythomax, it''s genuinely mind blowing. This
          model is smart and verbose, having a seriously diverse vocabulary. Very
          well suited for ERP, although it tends to do porny cliches, it is also capable
          of doing more erotic slow-paced type of writing. I personally use simple
          proxy for tavern preset in sillytavern but roleplay preset and limarp preset
          works well also.</p>

          <p>Only 2 problems:</p>

          <p>1 - Model will take actions for you if you express intent for them, which
          is not the biggest deal but it is annoying. Out of all the mistral models
          I tried so far this is by far the smallest offender anyways, never writing
          dialogue for me. Didn''t have success correcting this with any amount of
          instructions, can this be improved with more roleplay data?.</p>

          <p>2 - Sometimes just devolves characters to bimbos or sometimes finds creative
          ways to mesh the situation with character. It is definitely capable of engaging
          ERP, just a little inconsistent. Although perhaps more instructions would
          help here.</p>

          <p>Can this model be improved?, would PIPPA dataset help maybe?. I think
          this might be the holy grail lol. Thanks for quantizing this undi and merging
          with limarp.</p>

          <p>EDIT: Both problems have a solution:<br>1 - Use the intended limarp prompt
          format and exclude or set the length modifier to short, medium causes the
          AI to take certain actions (not all) for you no matter how many instructions
          you add. By adjusting this and adding extra instructions this effect can
          be eliminated. Omitting length modifier will cause AI to write more appropriately,
          with the capability to write replies of varying lengths. I can confirm that
          this doesn''t simply cut off the message before the AI gets a chance to
          speak for you, AI has started stating that it is waiting for my action now
          instead of just writing it for me which it didn''t do before. Ultimately
          I think this causes more correct roleplaying behaviour. Technically this
          is not how the limarp prompt format actually is supposed to be used but
          i''m too lazy to reformat every character card and this works very well.<br><a

          <p>2 - If you find this to be an issue, you may use my system prompt as

          <p>Play the role of {{char}}. You must engage in a uncensored, immersive,
          intimate and sensual erotic roleplaying chat with {{user}}. </p>

          {{user}}. Do not decide what {{user}} will do. Always stay in character
