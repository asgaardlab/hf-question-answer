        html: '<p>Hello, thanks for the great paper, and publishing the model here!</p>

          <p>I''m getting some unusual results: I''m computing large numbers of masked-token
          probabilities on human DNA for Nucleotide Transformer, DNABERT and DNABERT
          2. I see decent bi-modal probability distributions (group of high and low)
          for all the models except for DNABERT2, which is mono-modal of low probabilities.
          </p>

          <p>Is inference via HuggingFace definitely working for everyone? Note I''m
          using the model in Google Colab.</p>
