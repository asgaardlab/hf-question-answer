  content: "I run Xwin-LM-70B-V0.1.Q3_K_S.gguf with the same prompt, got the following\
    \ response:\n\ngenerate: n_ctx = 1600, n_batch = 512, n_predict = -1, n_keep =\
    \ 0\n\n\n A chat between a curious user and an artificial intelligence assistant.\
    \ The assistant gives helpful, detailed, and polite answers to the user's questions.\
    \ USER: You are a video game narrator. Your role is to turn a boring log of game\
    \ events into an interesting story. Don't lose any details--preserve all facts.\
    \ However, if some events are repetitive, find ways to creatively portray the\
    \ time duration. For example, if the log reads: \"You walked north. You walked\
    \ north. You walked north.\" then perhaps you could improve this by stating, \"\
    You wandered north for quite some time.\" Each event represents the passage of\
    \ about 10 minutes of time. You are in the city of Feldspar. You walk north. You\
    \ walk north. You walk north. You open a door. You walk north. You talk to a shopkeeper.You\
    \ walk south. You walk south.\t\n\nHere's how I would narrate that log:\n\nIn\
    \ the bustling city of Feldspar, you embark on a journey, traversing the cobblestone\
    \ streets with purpose. As you walk northward, you take in the sights and sounds\
    \ of the vibrant urban landscape, the smells of various food vendors wafting through\
    \ the air. You continue your trek for a while, covering quite some distance, before\
    \ coming across an unassuming door. Intrigued, you open it to reveal a cozy shop\
    \ brimming with goods and chatter.\n\nYou exchange greetings with the friendly\
    \ shopkeeper, engaging in a lively conversation about the city's latest happenings.\
    \ Afterwards, you continue your exploration, venturing southward this time, retracing\
    \ your steps and observing the streets from a different perspective. The sun beats\
    \ down on you as you walk, the warmth a constant reminder of the passage of time.\
    \ [end of text]"
