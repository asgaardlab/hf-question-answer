          \n\t</span></span> \uFF0CI can't accurately recall all the details, but\
          \ there were 2 questions roughly as follows:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>How to create\
          \ a microservice project using Micronaut, make it accept POST requests,\
          \ pass the commands included in that request to a local process, retrieve\
          \ and forward the std-out to a 3rd-party  service using POST? When answering\
          \ this question, there was a situation of self-questioning and self-answering,\
          \ and both the question and answer started with \"@someusername,\" and \"\
          they\" were talking about Spring Framework, not micronaut.</li>\n<li>How\
          \ to  love? This question was answered very well, until something like \"\
          in this book...\" appeared. The answer, when viewed in isolation, was perfect,\
          \ but it was clearly not appropriate.<br>My intuitive feeling is that it\
          \ is trying to play a certain role, or it erroneously thinks it is in some\
