  content: "Hi @doffery @hogworts and all friends here,\n\nWe sincerely thank all\
    \ the businesses and developers who submitted applications for commercial licenses\
    \ of the Yi model to 01.AI. Last night, we sent out emails to notify that your\
    \ applications have been successfully approved. You can now use the Yi model for\
    \ commercial purposes free of charge.\n\nWe would also like to take this opportunity\
    \ to inform everyone in advance that the commercial licensing agreement for the\
    \ Yi series models is about to be updated. \nUnder the new agreement, we will\
    \ adopt a more open approach to granting commercial licenses \u2013 the principle\
    \ being that once the application is completed, it implies that authorization\
    \ has been granted. Thus, you can confidently embark on your journey in commercializing\
    \ large-scale models right now!\n\nLastly, should you have any inquiries, requirements,\
    \ or wish to collaborate, please do not hesitate to contact us at yi@01.ai.\n\n\

    \ with our legal team, I'm pleased to outline the key principles for you:\n\n\
    1. Once you have fully completed the 'Yi Series Model Commercial Use Registration\
    \ Form' and submitted it successfully to yi@01.ai, you will immediately obtain\
    \ the license without the need to await a response from 01.AI; the commercial\
    \ license agreement becomes effective right upon submission.\n\n2. This license\
    \ has the potential for perpetual validity, provided that clients renew it every\
    \ two years. To renew, clients simply need to notify 01.AI at least one month\
    \ before the end of each two-year period, ensuring continuous validity of the\
    \ license.\n\n3. Although we reserve the right to modify the license agreement,\
    \ the version of the agreement you obtain based on the current major model version\
    \ remains valid, including the aforementioned method of continuous renewal.\n\n\
    We will design and publish the commercial licensing terms based on these principles,\
    \ and we will also send you a copy for reference once they are finalized and released\
    \ by our lawyers.\n\nThe fields required to be filled in the \"Yi Series Model\
    \ Commercial Use Registration Form\" are:\n- Name\n- Phone Number\n- Email\n-\
    \ Official Website or Individual Linkedin\n- Full name of the organization\n-\
    \ Please briefly describe the usage scenario (Please briefly describe the industry\
    \ and usage. There is no need to reveal confidential information. Overly casual\
    \ descriptions will affect the authorization review)\n\nOr you can just fill the\
    \ form at https://www.lingyiwanwu.com/yi-license. The content of the fields is\
    \ all the same.\n\nIf you would like to understand why we have designed the commercial\
    \ license agreement in this way, please refer to my other detailed explanation\
    \ in \"[Design Philosophy of the Yi Series Model Commercial License Agreement](https://huggingface.co/01-ai/Yi-34B/discussions/28#655c69909387d9090dfc1861).\"\
    \ \n\nThank you very much for your reading. \nWe hope to continue walking hand\
    \ in hand with you :)\n\nRichard Lin\nHead of Open Source, 01.AI"

          Yi model, in what scenarios they are using it, and whether they plan to
          continue using it after the initial two-year period. This is why we designed

          <ol>

          <li><p>Our initial intention is to open-source the Yi model with the hope

          <li><p>We hope that commercial users of Yi will inform us about their usage
          scenarios and their intentions regarding continued use. This will enable

          ways to enhance the Yi model, and potentially establish an ecosystem that
          supports everyone''s commercial success.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>Therefore, we plan to introduce the ''Yi Series Model Commercial
