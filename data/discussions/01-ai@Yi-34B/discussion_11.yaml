          <p>Thank you for the excellent model.</p>

          <p>It''s come to our understanding that Yi uses exactly Llama''s architecture
          except for two tensors renamed. (input_layernorm, post_attention_layernorm)</p>

          <p>Because there is a lot of investment and tooling around the llama architecture,
          there is value in using the same names for the tensors.</p>

          <p>The open source community will surely republish Yi with the tensors renamed
          in order to have a version that conforms to llama architecture.</p>

          <p>We hope that you would consider adopting this change into your official
          model, at this point in time before the model has gained significant adoption,
          so that it can ultimately enjoy the adoption it deserves.</p>

          <p>You missed the point.  What I''m saying is that politician is a <em>role</em>.  Whoever
          plays the role <em>is</em> a politician.  It doesn''t matter who they are,
          whether we''re in your future utopia or not, etc.  If there are people who
          professionally engage in political activity, they <em>are</em> politicians.  You
          said, "I can''t wait for the future in which our world will be run by engineers
          and not by politician and lawyers."<br>If an engineer takes on the role
          of "running the world", they are acting as politicians.  That is, they are
          practicing the "art or science of government" ("a person who is professionally
          involved in politics).  </p>

          <p>It is politic + ics.  If the engineers are the ones practicing the "art
          and science of governance" or whatever, they <em>are</em> politicians.   The
          point of my saying that was to imply that it is the <em>role itself</em>
          that makes a politician, not any particular sort of person.  That if engineers
          ran the world, they would become like politicians because THAT IS POLITICS.  It
          is human nature, not engineer or politician nature. That it doesn''t matter
          who you choose, if they are the ones who are charged with the affairs of
          running the state (polis), they <em>are</em> the politicians.  </p>

          <p>Got a state? Yup.<br>Got citizens who run the thing? (as opposed to a
