        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Why the interest in using Marcoroni? It''s also based on MetaMath-Cybertron-Starling
          which you use, but they added "just" 32k prompts, but those prompts were
          never shared, and it''s not clear if they were not contaminated by benchmark
          data.</p>

          <p>Thank you for the great work :-)<br>Laurent</p>
