        html: '<p>Hi guys, thank you for releasing these amazing control nets :) I''m
          experimenting with Revision one, but can''t figure out how to make it listen
          to my prompt also. Do I need to change ClipConditioning? I''ve already tried
          to low the strength but had no success.</p>

          <p>Another question/Request: Will you guys consider to release the REFERENCE_ONLY
          that is available to Auto1111? Reference_only is amazing to keep style and
          colors consistency for example to generate a set of cliparts with same style.
          I''ve used it a lot in Auto1111, and just keep dreaming to use it with SDXL,
          would be amazing! It was part of my everyday workflow with SD1.5. I know
          that has a comfy experiment for Reference_Only, but it doesn''t work as
          the auto1111 one, as we can''t change the strength or generation mode(prompt,
          image or both). These options make all the difference to control the style
          and creativity from prompts. Thank you!! :)</p>
