        html: '<p>I want to transcribe more than 100k recordings of 1000+ hours of
          recordings, I want to deploy whisper-large-v3 in a DLC container. Need help
          in choosing the right GPU tier, given I want to get the task done in less
          than 2 weeks, and okay spending a little extra on the GPU cost, Also want
          to know about batch processing, and how can i hit the end point with more
          than one recording at a time<br>Thanks in advance</p>
