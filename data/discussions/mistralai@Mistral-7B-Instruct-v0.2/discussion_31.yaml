        html: '<p>Hi Mistral Team,</p>

          <p>First off, I want to express my admiration for your amazing work with
          the models. They''re truly impressive! I''m considering using one of your
          models for an association I''m involved with. They have specific data sensitivity
          requirements, so I have a couple of inquiries regarding the training set.</p>

          <p>I''ve gone through your papers but couldn''t find specific details about
          this. Could you kindly confirm if the datasets used are rights-free, such
          as Redpajamas or CommonCrawl, and that no GPT-4 generated data were included?
          This information would greatly help us in making an informed decision.</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot for your help!</p>
