        html: '<p>Took me a while to figure out the right settings and everything
          but after that, this model is simply awesome, very smart, and follows directions.
          Sometimes mixes up characters/words but it''s obvious what it is trying
          to get at so it''s a very easy fix, as it seems to seldom switch up words
          and characters rather than simply be confused with the context completely.
          Haven''t tried it yet at very high contexts yet but so far the writing is
          significantly better than the previous one too (and in fact it is quite
          incredibly good). Keep up the great work! I don''t think I can foresee replacing
          or wanting to replace this one with another model for a while.</p>

        html: '<p>Good to hear!</p>

          <p>Yeah, its working well for me too. It seems to retain good performance
          up to 45K so far, grasping concepts and details from a big context, and
          often writing well, but sometimes makes silly mistakes like you said.</p>

          <p>I am using 0.05 MinP with 1.25 tau mirostat and 1.08 rep penalty, and
          adjusting the temperature.</p>

          <p>BTW, other models like Sus-Bagel may be quite good if you don''t need
          the mega context.</p>
