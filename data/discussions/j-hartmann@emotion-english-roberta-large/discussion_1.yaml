        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I would like to use this roberta-large checkpoint for emotion classification.
          Super useful work btw!</p>

          <p>Before I can embed it in my plugin, I need to check the license. Could
          you confirm what type of open source license this model is released with?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance,</p>
