        html: '<p>I am using this model to create background images, that can be used
          for various purposes (i.e. putting an object on the background image later
          on).<br>However, the model generates product images in the final picture
          as well (I only want a background picture, without any objects).</p>

          <p>For example, the prompt that I use is "A good background image that can
          be used for advertising mugs. Only provide the background image, do not
          include any other objects"<br>But the image actually includes mugs (which
          I do not want):</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/656fad3ed81a20af9c15cf4f/x2urwWpz5aitsrTWIX6fb.png"><img

          <p>Or in another example, the prompt is  "A good background image that can
          be used for advertising TVs. Only provide the background image, do not include
          any other objects"<br>but again, the image contains a TV:</p>

          <p>Can you please advise why the model puts objects in the image even though
          in the prompt we ask not to?</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>

        html: '<p>Because that isn''t how you prompt an image generation model yet.
          It can''t think or do any complex calculation to determine anything ambiguous
          in your prompt. In general it can''t follow instructions either.</p>

          <p>Simply describe what you want as if it were the caption of the image
          you are trying to create. "A photo of an modern living room with grey wood
          panel floor, warm lighting". The more words (tokens) you use, the less it
          will follow each word, so use as few as you can get away with. Order the
          most important things in the picture from left to right in your prompt.
          Put things in the negative prompt that you don''t want IF they show up in
          the image generated. "Furniture, painting, lamp", etc. You can find many
          tutorials on how to prompt SDXL on youtube etc. if you need more help.</p>
