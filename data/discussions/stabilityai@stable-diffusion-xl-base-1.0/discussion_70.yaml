        html: '<p>It looks like SDXL implemented the techniques described in "Common
          Diffusion Noise Schedules and Sample Steps are Flawed" (<a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08891.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2305.08891.pdf</a>)
          but I''m unable to replicate the output seen in that paper, specifically
          "solid black background," with vanilla SDXL and even with the params mentioned
          in figure 3 of that paper (DDIM, 50 steps, CFG 7.6 and rescale of 0.7).
          The output is definitely not solid black. Anything I should be changing?
          Or did I misunderstand that SDXL was using these techniques?</p>

          <p>(also, I could just use the different noise distribution hack but I was
          curious if the more fundamental issue was resolved now)</p>
