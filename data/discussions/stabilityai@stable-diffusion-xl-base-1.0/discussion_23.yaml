          <p>The first grid is synthesized in 1024x1024. Second - 512x512, same seed
          as 1024x1024. Third - 512x512, another seed.<br>First of all, lower resolution
          images look bad. Secondly, and more important, on the third grid there are
          two images which are complete mess.</p>

          <p>I wonder if there is any technique to solve this issue.<br>I am interested
          in low-res case because it would be much easier to train any personalization
          methods on 512x512 rather on 1024x1024.</p>
