        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>/* first of all, thank you <em>a lot</em> for releasing falcon-180B.
          This is a great step towards open science and democratizing LLMs - and a
          great precedent for future releases */</p>

          <p>We''d love to add falconllm-180B to Petals (a non-commercial research
          project) - <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals">https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals</a>
          .<br>This would allow people to run experiments with falcon-180B directly
          from their laptops or free colab instances.</p>

          <p>We''re concerned that our project technically contains a library-specific
          API (see readme). The purpose of this API is to let users run the distributed
          model from python in a way that is compatible with transformers (see <a
          rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/bigscience-workshop/petals#readme">code
          example</a>). The API is open-source and non-commercial, but it could theoretically
          fall under sections 9.1-9.4 of the license:</p>

          <p><code>9.1:  Hosting Use means any use of the Work or a Derivative Work
          to offer shared instances ... in an inference or finetuning API form </code>
          </p>

          <p>The license <a href="https://huggingface.co/tiiuae/falcon-180B/blob/main/LICENSE.txt#L22">suggests</a>
          that we send an email to <code>Falconllm.partnerships@tii.ae</code> and
          ask for permission.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, the <strong>emails don''t seem to get through</strong>.
          We get the following error message from all major email services:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/609baae0fe087f3d04cf0481/Jj6NZfuqpJF51pq3KUoQ8.png"><img

          <p><strong>Q1:</strong> can we use falcon-180B in Petals?</p>

          <p><strong>Q2:</strong> can you please check that the email is set up and
