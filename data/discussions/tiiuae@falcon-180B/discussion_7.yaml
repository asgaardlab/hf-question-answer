        html: '<p>I just wanted to share my appreciation for this release. In a time
          where regulatory capture and censorship within corporate models has reduced
          capabilities in the name of ''alignment'', releases like this give me hope
          for a better future. The only way forward is for AI to be in the hands of
          everyone, as the alternative is AI in the hands of the few.</p>

          <p>Falcon 180B is a major turning point for open source. This model is an
          icebreaker as the open source community can now tinker and innovate with
          a base model that is competitive with the best proprietary ones. This model
          will have an impact on personalized tutoring, specialized field specific
          tutoring, personalized assistants, personalized lawyers, and so much more
          without the censorship and privacy violations we are seeing from companies.</p>

          <p>The net positive value this release will provide cannot be understated
          so thank you! You guys are amazing and I feel like I had to write this to
          show my gratitude.</p>
