        html: '<p>I would like to know what needs to be done to make this model compatible
          for use locally without having to use the huggingface servers?</p>

          <p>I tried this by downloading the .bin model and renaming it to .pt and
          placing it in the whisper checkpoints folder, however when I try to run
          an inference I get an error saying that the model failed the sha256 verification,
          and thus the original small model is downloaded,</p>

          <p>Is it possible to use this model locally?</p>

          <p>Thank you for your answer in advance!</p>
