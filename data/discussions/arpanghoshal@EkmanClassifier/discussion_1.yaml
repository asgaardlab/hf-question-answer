        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>If possible, could you please include your achieved metrics and the hyperparams
          you used to fine-tune BERT in your <code>README.md</code>?<br>Also, I see
          that you used the Go dataset. Did you just merge the 28 classes into these
          6?</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot!</p>
