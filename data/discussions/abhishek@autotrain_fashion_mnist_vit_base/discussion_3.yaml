        html: '<p>Hey. I have some problem using ViT (which is pre-trained on ImageNet)
          to fine-tune MNIST.<br>It is because MNIST is of channel 1, while  the ImageProcessor
          for ViT requires channel of 3. There will be mismatch in normalizing the
          images.</p>

          <p>The error msg is <code>ValueError: mean must have 1 elements if it is
          an iterable, got 3.</code></p>

          <p>Do you have any ideas? Maybe I should expand the MNIST to 3-dimension
          before i feed the images to ImageProcessor? or should i modify the mean/std
          in ImageProcessor?</p>
