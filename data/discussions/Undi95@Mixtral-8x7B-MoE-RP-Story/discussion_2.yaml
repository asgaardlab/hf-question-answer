        html: '<p>I haven''t tried much RP but it does exceptionally well with task
          based prompts. It enthusiastically writes guides about basically any topic
          with great amounts of detail and is happy to elaborate even more if asked.
          Creative writing is a bit better as well. It also lacks the patronizing
          notes that the official instruct variant tends to add which only eat into
          the context limit.</p>

          <p>The only issue I''ve had with it is that it requires a slightly higher
          repetition penalty or else its writing gets somewhat repetitive. It also
          tends to write in small stanzas instead of larger paragraphs, something
          I''ve seen with the official mixtral instruct as well. Can probably be fixed
          with prompting.</p>
