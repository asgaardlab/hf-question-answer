        html: '<p>Hi Philipp,</p>

          <p>thanks for your interest. Currently I am not planning to open-source
          the dataset. This is for two reasons:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>As the translation has been done using the OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo API,
          I don''t want to interfere with any of OpenAI restrictions of using their
          model.</li>

          <li>During the translation, some of the rows of the dataset where lost due
          to some API timeout errors. Unfortunately I don''t have a way to recover
          them as of right now, as I don''t know which rows are affected. Therefore
          the dataset that I have been using is not 100% complete.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Once I have a little bit more time I will look into both points and might
          decide to open-source the translated dataset at a later point in time.</p>
