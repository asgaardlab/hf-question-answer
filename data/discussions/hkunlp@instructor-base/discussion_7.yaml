        html: '<p>Thanks for your comment!</p>

          <p>I agree that the INSTRUCTOR model can be potentially applied in other
          domains for computer vision. The key part would probably be the design of
          the instruction and the merge to the input. For the training/fine-tuning
          part, I think it would be similar to that of the INSTRUCTOR model with contrastive
          loss.</p>
