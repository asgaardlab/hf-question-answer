        html: '<p>Thank you very much for your interests!</p>

          <p>We are considering making this model multilingual. It is very easy to
          finetune the model on more specific tasks. You may prepare the data following
          the format in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding#training">https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding#training</a>,
          store them as a json file and name it as medi-data.json. Next, just follow
          the README: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding#train-instructor">https://github.com/HKUNLP/instructor-embedding#train-instructor</a>,
          and train the model!</p>

          <p>If you encounter any problem, feel free to leave your question here or
          contact me at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:hjsu@cs.hku.hk">hjsu@cs.hku.hk</a>!</p>
