          <p>I think your dataset is great --- it just seems like you could re-train
          it as a style rather than as an object and get the intended result -- I''m
          assuming the goal would be to provide a prompt like "rough wood depthmap"
          and receive something usable in a program like blender -- which could be
          very beneficial </p>

          <p>Nice work!</p>
