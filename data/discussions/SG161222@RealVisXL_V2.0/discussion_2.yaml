          <p>Thank you for your reply. I''m also very interested in your inpainting
          model. I''d want to know if the inpainting model is just merged from the
          Realistic_Vision_V5.1 and base stable-diffusion-inpainting model (not training)
          or fine-tuned (add 5 addtional channel and training)? Sorry my grammar is
          poor, I hope I made that clear.</p>
