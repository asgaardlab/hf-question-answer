        html: '<p>I build a package for llama.cpp that wraps it in a node module,
          it gives you a socket client and a hostable server that responds and interchanges

          the wappclient. Its fully working and it has examples on how to add more

          <p>PS: Any idea if i can use langchain without the 65K storywriting mode?
          Im very new to the scene, and haven''t gotten into the actual trainings.
          i only do conversions, Frankenstein shit together really. But ive never
