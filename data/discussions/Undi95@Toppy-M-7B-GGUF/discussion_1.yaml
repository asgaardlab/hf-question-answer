        html: '<p>Had a little play with it. Prose seems similar to the two other
          models capybara and zephyr (which is to say, more compelling than the vast
          majority of Mistral models and probably as good as any high rated 13b) -
          perhaps a little more down and dirty, and perhaps a little more aware of
          context and how things work.  </p>

          <p>It seems slightly smarter though, like it''s pulling info from the instructions
          and character card, which I haven''t really seen Mistral do properly before,
          even the models with lima rp or pippa - not even from the mistral merges
          and tunes that are supposed to be good at instruct. Which is honestly the
          area where 7b''s are the weakest (instruct and comprehension), so a good
          win probably. Usually when I see any mistral or 7b merge referencing my
          cards or instructions it''s literally misinterpreting it somehow (and that''s
          pretty rare). Here it did it a quite few times, correctly.  ofc, it''s not
          doing this consistently but it''s 7b what do you expect lol!</p>

          <p>Wasn''t sure if I''d ever see a 7b model really do that even some of
          the time properly. </p>

          <p>Overall, really good actually on first test.  If you find time to put
          up the HF python model I''d totally download that in case there are any
          future merges that might be worth playing with. </p>

          <p>Yeah, solid I think. Feels like the 7b version of Stheno or Mlewd-xwin
          tbh. Obviously can never be quite as good as a 13b, but boy does it feel
          close.  Finally feels like that stage we got to with 13b, where it''s a
          real high quality merge that has all the right elements. </p>

          <p>Also, and I''m not sure if this was dumb luck, but I seemed to get less
          repetition than other mistrals. Certainly no identical replies which for
          Mistral is common for pretty much anything I''ve tried. </p>

          <p>Edit after a month: The prose IS really good IMO, combination of the
          base models and loras. However I might have overstated any cleverness. It
          does sometimes pick up from cards, which admitted most other models do not
          do well, but probably it''s instruct following is still an area for improvement.
