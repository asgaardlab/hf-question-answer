          open source coding model for game development so i didnt have to pay for
          Gpt-4 from open ai. </p>

          <p>At the time however models like wizardcoder-15b were far from anything
          usable for coding anywhere near even gpt 3.5 base. So i wanted to change
          that.</p>

          <p>I created the Megacode, then the LosslessMegacode and Limitlessmegacode
          datasets in the hopes that one day someone would be be inspired to use that
          coding data to train open source ai models to compete with open ai. </p>

          <p>I failed. However you succeeded. And for that i thank you. Now i can
          do what ive always dreamed of. For that i thank you and your team. </p>
