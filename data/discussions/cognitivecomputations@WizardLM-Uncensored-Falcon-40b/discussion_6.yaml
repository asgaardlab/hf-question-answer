        html: '<p>Hi - New to this so bear with me. :)  I''m not able to get the model
          to answer questions.  I get the error: "Failed to deserialize the JSON body
          into the target type: inputs: invalid type: map, expected a string..." if
          there is a dict after "inputs".  Also the responses on text completion only
          seem to be around 100 tokens.  Is there something I am missing here to expand
          them? Thanks!</p>
