        html: '<p>This could well change the game for mixtral small. It''s prose is
          a little lacking. Honestly it''s otherwise pretty fabulous so this is really
          useful!</p>

          <p>Query: Would you ever consider doing a upstage/solar instruct noromaid?
          </p>

          <p>Noromaid really is one of the highlights of current finetuning and it
          would be lovely to have a model I can run on my PC that isn''t a mistral
          7b. Solar really does seem quite smart but it''s prose is as dry as old
          toast. Honestly could use a whole heap of finetuning. </p>

          <p>Currently I''m leaning towards models I can''t run on my PC like mixtral
          small, and mixtral medium and it makes me sad :(</p>
