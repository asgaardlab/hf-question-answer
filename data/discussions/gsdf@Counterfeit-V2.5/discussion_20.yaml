        html: '<p>in the vae subdir there are safetensor and .pt files, approximately
          the same size.</p>

          <p>At the top level, there is  a .pt file that is TWICE THE SIZE (and probably
          the one that triggered the virus warning?)</p>

          <p>The annoying thing is.. the top level one produces BETTER results, in
          my opinion.<br>Can anyone shed light on why the difference.... and ideally,
          how to safely convert that top level one to a safetensor, ensureing it only
          has actual "safe tensors" in it?</p>
