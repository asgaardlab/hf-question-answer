        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>First of all I must say that I really love this model that you''ve made.
          Amazing work 10/10!</p>

          <p>I do have a question about a specific thing in this model. Almost all
          images I generate with this that show skin generate with a lot of muscles
          and other things visible on the skin. What keywords should I use to make
          an average build female with smooth skin. Not fat but also no muscle tones
          in the skin.</p>

          <p>Really hope to get your insight into this!</p>

          <p>Kind regards,<br>Namanix</p>
