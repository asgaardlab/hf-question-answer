        html: '<p>AutoGPTQ is riduclously slow, unusable for me. ExllamaHF runs fast
          (relatively), i use it with mythomax model, but after a few text gens the
          responses are now gibberish. So can someone recommend a setup for running
          this model in oobabooga please?</p>

          <p>Until i buy new...i have a 8gb gpu unfortunately.  I want to utilize
          the 8k context so its currently set to:<br>max_seq_len 8192, alpha_value
          1, rope_freq_base 0, compress_pos_emb 1.<br>I set comp pos emb to 2 and
          it fixed the responses but also negates having the larger 8k context, does
          it not? and wouldnt setting it to 4 make the context 2k effectively?</p>
