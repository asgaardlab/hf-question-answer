          1.  For Modifying the model, have a look here https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/tree/main/ldm/models


          This model is quite complicated and contains lots of submodules (diffusion/,
          autoencoder.py, transformer.py etc.). But seeing what the authors have done
          is a great guide to starting out.


          Look for classes that inhering from nn.Module e.g. `ldm/modules/encoders/modules.py:class
          ClassEmbedder(nn.Module):`


          Also looking at the [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2112.10752) will explain
          some of the model decisions: what the authors did and why


          I know that''s a lot, but there is so much to learn by just studying why
          each line exists in that code folder!


          2. You need to train this model somehow. Here I am not sure what''s the
          best way to proceed. The paper gives some details on this, particularly
          section 4.2. Image Generation with Latent Diffusion


          3. After training, you can Use this page to safe the model state (ckpt):
          https://pytorch.org/tutorials/recipes/recipes/saving_and_loading_a_general_checkpoint.html
