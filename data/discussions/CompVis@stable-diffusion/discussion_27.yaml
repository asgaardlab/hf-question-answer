        html: "<p>Hi. I'm sorry if this report is unnecessarily disruptive.  I had\

          \ of providing answers.  I think it's an important legal issue and I hope\

          \ Copyrighted materials in the LAION dataset that was used to train all\
          \ these models.  This applies to 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 and 1.4 in this repository.</em></p>\n\
          <p>It's not my wish to opt-out of the dataset or have that removed as I\
          \ understand it serves an important purpose for the community.  Besides,\
          \ the training has already happened and it's too late to do anything about\
          \ that.</p>\n<p>Therefore: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>I hereby claim, as a rightsholder\

          \ licensing these models under the OpenRAIL-M license.</li>\n<li>I hereby\
          \ request that the license of the models be formally withdrawn (or declared\
          \ void anyway) and new terms be written that are compliant with the EU Copyright\
          \ Directive.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>I believe this is an honest mistake on the\
          \ part of CompVis, and I hope it can be addressed quickly to address the\
          \ concerns of rightsholders involved \u2014 including myself.</p>\n<p>I\
          \ address both points in more detail below.</p>\n<h2 id=\"i-legal-basis\"\
          >I. LEGAL BASIS</h2>\n<p>No legal basis has been established that allows\
          \ licensing of these models under any license, as there's no evidence CompVis\
          \ alone has the rights to this model.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Meta recently claimed\
          \ Copyright over the LLaMa weights, and HuggingFace took them down, thus\
          \ we can assume that Copyright is involved for ML models.</li>\n<li>It's\
          \ unknown if the models are a derivative work of the training data or not,\
          \ based on comments from experts of LAION and HF [1,2] and research papers\
          \ [3].</li>\n<li>The ownership of Copyrights in the model is unknown and\
          \ thus none of the parties involved are able to license the model without\
          \ potentially infringing the rights of others.</li>\n<li>The legal basis\
          \ the model was created under is Article 3 of Directive (EU) 2019/790 on\
          \ Copyright in the Digital Single Market (C-DSM).</li>\n<li>Thus, the conditions\
          \ set forth by the C-DSM are the only established basis under which it can\
          \ be released \u2014 if at all.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>If there are any counter-arguments\
          \ that (i) the model is known to not be a derivative work of the dataset,\
          \ and (ii) the C-DSM's Article 3 allows for redistribution and licensing,\
          \ please put them in written form.  I have compiled research that suggests\
          \ both of these would be incorrect, but I welcome your proof nontheless.</p>\n\
          <h2 id=\"ii-license-change\">II. LICENSE CHANGE</h2>\n<p>Given the situation,\
          \ my request is not to have the models taken down as they serve an important\
          \ role in the community.</p>\n<p>However, I request the following:</p>\n\
          <ul>\n<li>The license should be withdrawn as CompVis is unable to grant\
          \ these rights.  Alternatively, the license should be declared void for\
          \ the same reason.</li>\n<li>New terms that clarify the legal framework\
          \ under which the research was done should be written, specifically allowing\
          \ for only scientific research and cultural works \u2014 in both cases only\
          \ non-profit organizations (as described in the C-DSM).</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please\
          \ note that these are my best suggestions to resolve this constructively\
          \ and in a way that's non-destructive to the community.  I believe there's\
          \ a legal basis for any rightsholder to have the models completely taken\
          \ down, but that's not an option I would personally like to pursue.</p>\n\
          <p>I had hoped to receive better answers directly from HuggingFace, since\
          \ it's their platform, and the release of models is a core use.  Indeed,\
          \ you would expect HF to have better legal understanding of these kinds\
          \ of topics.  As it stands, it looks like they didn't even envisage the\
          \ legal aspects of model distribution under Copyright laws worldwide \u2014\
