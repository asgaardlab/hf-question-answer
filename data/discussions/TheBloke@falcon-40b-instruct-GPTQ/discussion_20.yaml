        html: '<p>Thank you very much for your effort with this GPTQ version! It is
          more convenient using your model with a consumer GPU and more affordable
          to do fine-tuning. However I am a lit bit confused about why the 4bit version
          is slower? I am not very familiar with those computer science fundamentals
          but is it supposed to be faster if using lower precisions? Really appreciated
          if someone could explain this to me!</p>
