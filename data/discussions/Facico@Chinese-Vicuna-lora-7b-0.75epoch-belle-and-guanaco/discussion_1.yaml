        html: '<p>We would like to inform you that the GuanacoDataSet has recently
          transitioned from using the OpenRAIL license to the GPLv3 license. This
          transition has implications for models trained using the dataset, as there
          are restrictions on their use.</p>

          <p>Please note that if you are using a model with an Apache license, it
          may not be compatible with the new version of the dataset. This is because
          the Apache license allows anyone to use, copy, modify, and distribute the
          software for any purpose, while the OpenRAIL license has usage restrictions
          that may not be compatible with open source definitions.</p>

          <p>Therefore, if you wish to continue using the GuanacoDataSet, you have
          two options: either you can adopt the OpenRAIL license and add usage restrictions
          to your model, or you can update to the latest version of the dataset, which
          uses the GPLv3 license. We strongly recommend the latter option, as it only
          requires you to inherit the license without any additional restrictions.</p>

          <p>Please note that if you choose to continue using the dataset under the
          OpenRAIL license, you may not be able to access the latest updates to the
          dataset. This is because the new version of the dataset is released under
          the GPLv3 license, which is not compatible with the OpenRAIL license.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your attention, and please do not hesitate to contact us
          if you have any further questions or concerns.</p>
