        html: '<p>Thanks for your contributions! I noticed there''s four different
          versions of 2.1 ORIGINAL in varying dimensions. I''ve never worked with
          such unusual dimensions, 1024x256 is a rarely-used size. Is it primarily
          for landscapes and wide-angle views?  I presume each model is tied to the
          stated dimensions and they can''t be changed on the fly as in Python with
          the Automatic1111 repo?</p>
