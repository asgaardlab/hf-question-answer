        html: '<p>It''s a prompt from 4chan with the "fashion skirt" tokens added
          at the end, that produces these style of dresses, since Stable Diffusion
          doesn''t have a real understanding of the prompt, what I do is mixing different
          prompt pieces from different prompts and see what''s the outcome, as opposed
          to having an idea and making the model produce an image of it (I gave up
          on that.) I used it as the example because I liked its outputs.</p>

          <p>Please explain what you find weird about the following pictures that
          were produced with the same prompt, unless you''re getting a reaction you
          shouldn''t be having (e.g. research cute aggression):</p>
