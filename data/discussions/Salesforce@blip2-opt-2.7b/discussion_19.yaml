        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Note that the BLIP-2 models (like the one of this repository) assume
          that the CLIP model being used is a very specific one, namely an EVA-CLIP
          one with 39 layers in its vision encoder as seen <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/salesforce/LAVIS/blob/main/lavis/models/eva_vit.py#L442">here</a>.
          If you will pass embeddings from a different CLIP model, then the output
          will be random. You could pass them by replacing <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/blob/v4.28.1/src/transformers/models/blip_2/modeling_blip_2.py#L1720">this
          line</a> by your custom embeddings (so this would require forking the library
          and passing them there). Alternatively, we could also add an <code>image_embeds</code>
          argument to the forward method of <code>Blip2ForConditionalGeneration</code>
          such that you can easily pass them. Could you open an issue on the Transformers
          library for that?</p>
