        html: '<p>I followed the deploy instructions to host the blip2 model in a
          SageMaker endpoint. However, it''s unclear how to go about calling an inference
          with an image and prompt? Do you use the HF predictor class or the SageMaker
          runtime client? What are the correct methods to structure the payload for
          each (if both work)? The use case is with AWS Lambda and the examples provided
          don''t cover this well.</p>

          <p>thanks!</p>
