          not be clear (I''ll fix this in our readmes shortly) is that we use an additional
          newline after <code>&lt;|assistant|&gt;</code>. I played around with your
          model briefly and this seemed to make a big difference, and might explain

          <p>Thanks very much for that clarification!  Since making the READMEs I
          had heard from a couple of people that your prompt was working fine, so
          I planned to test again but hadn''t had a chance to yet.</p>

          <p>I will update my READMEs now to make this clear, and remove the other
          prompts.  And yeah it''s really interesting that they work despite no training!
          These models really are smart.</p>

          <p>Thanks again for getting in touch, and for for all the great models you
          guys are uploading.</p>
