          <p>I haven''t personally used oogabooga, but generally you would want to
          use GPTQ or GGML for fast inference and lower vram requirements at home.</p>

          <p>It would require ~12GB of vram, if you dont have that you will need 12GB
          of ram, GGML supports CPU, GPTQ/Exllama does not</p>

          <p>It supports up to 4096 context size for new tokens, but less will keep
          your vram and performance in check</p>
