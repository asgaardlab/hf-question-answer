          <p>Dear Huggingface Team,</p>\n<p>I wish to bring to your attention a potentially\
          \ grave ethical concern surrounding one of the voice models hosted on your\
          \ platform. It has come to my notice that there exists a model based on\
          \ SWAN, a child YouTuber known as \"SWAN the voice\".</p>\n<p>Here are the\
          \ primary concerns:</p>\n<pre><code>Minor\u2019s Privacy: SWAN is currently\
          \ just 11 years old. Using the voice of a minor to craft a model, especially\
          \ without explicit consent from him or his legal guardians, raises profound\
          \ ethical questions.\n\nSWAN\u2019s Current Situation: With the prevailing\
          \ knowledge of SWAN's personal circumstances, the existence and potential\
          \ misuse of such a model can lead to mockery, manipulation, and emotional\
          \ distress for the child.\n\nPotential Misuse: The creation and availability\
          \ of such a model might facilitate malicious or inappropriate use, potentially\
          \ causing harm to SWAN or his reputation.\n</code></pre>\n<p>I kindly request\
          \ you to reconsider the hosting of this model on your platform and to ensure\
          \ that ethical considerations remain paramount in your endeavors.</p>\n\
          <p>Thank you for attending to this critical concern. I trust Huggingface\
          \ will act in the best interest of all individuals, especially minors.</p>\n\
          <p>Warm regards</p>\n"
