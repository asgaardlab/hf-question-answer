        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>thank you for providing this great open-source resource! :) I was wondering
          if you could add a tokenizer_config.json file? I was trying to run the model
          with transformers, but ran into problems... I realized that the tokenizer
          does not take care of longer sequences (i.e. &gt;512) causing errors.</p>
