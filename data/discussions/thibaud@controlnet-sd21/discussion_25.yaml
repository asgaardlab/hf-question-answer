          <p>Glad to hear it, and great job thus far! I noticed you added a "color"
          model recently, but I''m not entirely sure how it works based on the example
          you gave, and haven''t seen any other "color" ControlNet models before,
          nor documentation on how it works. Could you possibly give a description
          of it, or link to the documentation you based it off? I normally prefer
          to use ControlNet without a preprocessor if I can, but based on the example
          I don''t know if that''s possible, nor the workflow that would go into using
          it. Thanks!</p>

        html: '<p>Very interesting, though I should note that I am struggling to get
          good results like the Discord attachment you provided shows. In txt2img
          the results are often far too noisy at any weight lower than 2, and don''t
          have much of a change in color at anything 1 or lower. A weight of 2 can
          produce an image closest to what I am going for without too much visual
          noise, but the issue is that the image then starts to look like a rough,
          washed out oil painting, which is not at all like the style I am going for.
          Whether a weight of 0 or 2 produces better results is up to personal preference,
          and I am as of yet undecided, as the details appear better with a weight
          of 2 than a weight of 0, but the art style I am going for is not being adhered
          to.</p>

          <p>Conversely, any weight between 0 and 2 on img2img just doesn''t seem
          to have any effect on the image at all unless used with a denoising strength
          above 0.75, and even then I just can''t seem to get results that are good
          enough to use.</p>

          <p>It should be noted that I am not using the color preprocessor, and am
          instead using a custom pixelated color map in 16x16 of the color output
          I would like to see relative to an unweighted generation, since the preprocessor
          was giving what was virtually the exact same output I was going for with
          an annotator resolution of 1024 anyways. This might just be an issue the
          SD model I am using it on, or with the variety of generation settings in
          both SD and ControlNet I have, but I thought it might be good feedback for
          you to have.</p>

          <p>Anywho, I won''t derail from the original topic any further. Great job
          thus far, and thanks a ton for your work! I greatly look forward to seeing
          more from you :)</p>

  content: 'Very interesting, though I should note that I am struggling to get good
    results like the Discord attachment you provided shows. In txt2img the results
    are often far too noisy at any weight lower than 2, and don''t have much of a
    change in color at anything 1 or lower. A weight of 2 can produce an image closest
    to what I am going for without too much visual noise, but the issue is that the
    image then starts to look like a rough, washed out oil painting, which is not
    at all like the style I am going for. Whether a weight of 0 or 2 produces better
    results is up to personal preference, and I am as of yet undecided, as the details
    appear better with a weight of 2 than a weight of 0, but the art style I am going
    for is not being adhered to.


    Conversely, any weight between 0 and 2 on img2img just doesn''t seem to have any
    effect on the image at all unless used with a denoising strength above 0.75, and
    even then I just can''t seem to get results that are good enough to use.


    It should be noted that I am not using the color preprocessor, and am instead
    using a custom pixelated color map in 16x16 of the color output I would like to
    see relative to an unweighted generation, since the preprocessor was giving what
    was virtually the exact same output I was going for with an annotator resolution
    of 1024 anyways. This might just be an issue the SD model I am using it on, or
    with the variety of generation settings in both SD and ControlNet I have, but
    I thought it might be good feedback for you to have.


    Anywho, I won''t derail from the original topic any further. Great job thus far,
    and thanks a ton for your work! I greatly look forward to seeing more from you
    :)'
