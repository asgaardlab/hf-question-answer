        html: '<p>Hi :) </p>

          <p>I am new to using those kind of models in hugging face.<br>I have a piece
          of code to using control net as it is seen in the example on page : <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/controlnet">https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/main/en/api/pipelines/stable_diffusion/controlnet</a></p>

          <p>However, as I am not sure how to use your models.<br>How do I load them
          to use them as controller using StableDiffusionControlNetPipeline and ControlNetModel
          Huggingface pipelines</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance :)</p>
