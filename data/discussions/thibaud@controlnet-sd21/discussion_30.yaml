        html: '<p>I''m having trouble making the scribble model work. I am using automatic1111
          with sd-webui-controlnet extension. I do a basic scribble in img2img but
          the result does not take the scribble into account. Also in the result folder
          I usually see the scribble being generated along with the result image,
          but there is no scribble image there. I have tried both the 512 and the
          768 versions of SD-2.1. I have tried img2img and text2img in automatic1111.
          I have tried preprocessor scribble and fake scribble</p>
