        html: "<p>Found loop, by the way (So to a customer it's better to check the\
          \ output for loops.):</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>How can I improve my time management\
          \ skills?<br>You can improve your time management skills in the following\
          \ ways:</p>\n</blockquote>\n<ol>\n<li><p><strong>Prioritise and Plan</strong>:\
          \ One of the main aspects of effective time management is setting priorities\
          \ and consistently taking action according to them. Start each day by identifying\
          \ the most important things you want to accomplish that day or week. If\
          \ possible, break them down into smaller parts or steps and spread them\
          \ out over time throughout the day or week.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Avoid\
          \ transitions</strong>: When you move from one task to another, there is\
          \ a transition process that takes time and you can get lost in it. If possible,\
          \ avoid transitions by continuing to work on one task until the end or breaking\
          \ it into smaller parts.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Eliminate Distancing</strong>:\
          \ If you work in a team, try to get closer to your colleagues to avoid wasting\
          \ time walking from one place to another or walking distance to the phone\
          \ to communicate.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Use Timers</strong>: Setting\
          \ and using a timer is a good way to control the time you devote to each\
          \ task. You can set a timer for a certain amount of time and stop it when\
          \ you finish that task.</p>\n</li>\n<li><p><strong>Train yourself to say\
          \ \u201CNo\u201D</strong>: A lot of time can be wasted on things that are\

        raw: "Found loop, by the way (So to a customer it's better to check the output\
          \ for loops.):\n\n\n> How can I improve my time management skills?\nYou\
          \ can improve your time management skills in the following ways:\n\n1. **Prioritise\
          \ and Plan**: One of the main aspects of effective time management is setting\
          \ priorities and consistently taking action according to them. Start each\
          \ day by identifying the most important things you want to accomplish that\
          \ day or week. If possible, break them down into smaller parts or steps\
          \ and spread them out over time throughout the day or week.\n\n2. **Avoid\
          \ transitions**: When you move from one task to another, there is a transition\
          \ process that takes time and you can get lost in it. If possible, avoid\
          \ transitions by continuing to work on one task until the end or breaking\
          \ it into smaller parts.\n\n3. **Eliminate Distancing**: If you work in\
          \ a team, try to get closer to your colleagues to avoid wasting time walking\
          \ from one place to another or walking distance to the phone to communicate.\n\
          \n4. **Use Timers**: Setting and using a timer is a good way to control\
          \ the time you devote to each task. You can set a timer for a certain amount\
          \ of time and stop it when you finish that task.\n\n5. **Train yourself\
          \ to say \u201CNo\u201D**: A lot of time can be wasted on things that are\
          \ not important or even necessary, so train yourself to say \u201Cno\u201D\
          \ when asked to do something that will distract you from important things.\n\
          \n6. **Eliminate Distancing**: If you work in an office or home, try moving\
          \ closer to your desk to avoid wasting time moving from one area to another.\n\
          \n7. **Evaluate Results**: Remember to check what you have achieved at the\
          \ end of each session of working on a specific task or project. If you do\
          \ not achieve the desired result, you may need to change your approach or\
          \ add some more time.\n\n8. **Handle Email Effectively**: Email is a big\
          \ source of distancing and task jumping, so you'll want to set strict rules\
          \ for handling emails. For example, decide to read and respond to all emails\
          \ only at certain points in the day, or divide them into categories (important,\
          \ average, unimportant) and process them accordingly.\n\n9. **Eliminate\
          \ entertainment**: If you often spend time on the Internet or TV, try setting\
          \ a blocker to access these resources during workdays.\n\n10. **Practise\
          \ Concentration**: Learn to focus on your work, regardless of external stimuli\
          \ or distance. This can help reduce the time you spend on transitions and\
          \ diversions.\n\n11. **Explore technology**: Mobile apps or personal assistants\
          \ can help you with planning and time management. Don't be afraid to try\
          \ new tools if they can make your job easier.\n\n12. **Set Boundaries**:\
          \ Set specific hours for yourself when you work, and try not to get distracted\
          \ during those hours. You may need to notify co-workers or family about\
          \ this so they know you are not available for helpless conversations at\
          \ certain times.\n\n13. **Keep work and personal tasks separate**: If you\
          \ work from home, try creating a separate work area to make it easier to\
          \ switch between personal and work time.\n\n14. **Evaluate your effectiveness**:\
          \ Sometimes you just need to stop and evaluate how you spent your time over\
          \ the last day or week. It may become clear to you in which aspects of time\
          \ management you still need to improve.\n\n15. **Practise your speed**:\
          \ There is nothing wrong with practicing your speed in completing certain\

  content: "Found loop, by the way (So to a customer it's better to check the output\
    \ for loops.):\n\n\n> How can I improve my time management skills?\nYou can improve\
    \ your time management skills in the following ways:\n\n1. **Prioritise and Plan**:\
    \ One of the main aspects of effective time management is setting priorities and\
    \ consistently taking action according to them. Start each day by identifying\
    \ the most important things you want to accomplish that day or week. If possible,\
    \ break them down into smaller parts or steps and spread them out over time throughout\
    \ the day or week.\n\n2. **Avoid transitions**: When you move from one task to\
    \ another, there is a transition process that takes time and you can get lost\
    \ in it. If possible, avoid transitions by continuing to work on one task until\
    \ the end or breaking it into smaller parts.\n\n3. **Eliminate Distancing**: If\
    \ you work in a team, try to get closer to your colleagues to avoid wasting time\
    \ walking from one place to another or walking distance to the phone to communicate.\n\
    \n4. **Use Timers**: Setting and using a timer is a good way to control the time\
    \ you devote to each task. You can set a timer for a certain amount of time and\
    \ stop it when you finish that task.\n\n5. **Train yourself to say \u201CNo\u201D\
    **: A lot of time can be wasted on things that are not important or even necessary,\
    \ so train yourself to say \u201Cno\u201D when asked to do something that will\
    \ distract you from important things.\n\n6. **Eliminate Distancing**: If you work\
    \ in an office or home, try moving closer to your desk to avoid wasting time moving\
    \ from one area to another.\n\n7. **Evaluate Results**: Remember to check what\
    \ you have achieved at the end of each session of working on a specific task or\
    \ project. If you do not achieve the desired result, you may need to change your\
    \ approach or add some more time.\n\n8. **Handle Email Effectively**: Email is\
    \ a big source of distancing and task jumping, so you'll want to set strict rules\
    \ for handling emails. For example, decide to read and respond to all emails only\
    \ at certain points in the day, or divide them into categories (important, average,\
    \ unimportant) and process them accordingly.\n\n9. **Eliminate entertainment**:\
    \ If you often spend time on the Internet or TV, try setting a blocker to access\
    \ these resources during workdays.\n\n10. **Practise Concentration**: Learn to\
    \ focus on your work, regardless of external stimuli or distance. This can help\
    \ reduce the time you spend on transitions and diversions.\n\n11. **Explore technology**:\
    \ Mobile apps or personal assistants can help you with planning and time management.\
    \ Don't be afraid to try new tools if they can make your job easier.\n\n12. **Set\
    \ Boundaries**: Set specific hours for yourself when you work, and try not to\
    \ get distracted during those hours. You may need to notify co-workers or family\
    \ about this so they know you are not available for helpless conversations at\
    \ certain times.\n\n13. **Keep work and personal tasks separate**: If you work\
    \ from home, try creating a separate work area to make it easier to switch between\
    \ personal and work time.\n\n14. **Evaluate your effectiveness**: Sometimes you\
    \ just need to stop and evaluate how you spent your time over the last day or\
    \ week. It may become clear to you in which aspects of time management you still\
    \ need to improve.\n\n15. **Practise your speed**: There is nothing wrong with\
    \ practicing your speed in completing certain tasks so that you can complete them\
    \ faster. This can help avoid extended work breaks or distancing.\n\n16. **Learn\
    \ techniques to reduce stress**: If you have trouble concentrating due to stress,\
    \ try relaxation or meditation before starting your workday. This can help reduce\
    \ stress and allow you to better concentrate on tasks.\n\n17. **Learn Emotion\
    \ Management**: The ability to manage your emotions is a key aspect of effective\
    \ time management, as excess emotions can affect your ability to concentrate and\
    \ productivity.\n\n18. **Try working as part of a team**: If you've usually only\
    \ worked on your own, consider becoming part of a team or project with set deadlines.\
    \ This may force you to plan and manage your time more effectively.\n\n19. **Practice\
    \ Sharing**: If you frequently overload your memory, try practicing chunking to\
    \ avoid overflow and reduce your processing time.\n\n20. **Try Different Methods**:\
    \ Don't stick to one time management method if it doesn't work for you. Explore\
    \ other methods and try them to find the one you like. Which one is better suited\
    \ for you.\n\n21. **Use Helpers**: Don't be afraid to ask for help from colleagues\
    \ or outside consultants if you encounter a difficult problem or don't know how\
    \ best to allocate your time.\n\n22. **Set Breakers**: If you find it difficult\
    \ to stay focused for long periods of time, try setting yourself periodic breaks.\
    \ For example, you can divide your workday into blocks of 50 minutes of work and\
    \ 10 minutes of rest.\n\n23. **Improve Your Environment**: If your desk or office\
    \ is cluttered, it can affect your productivity as you will waste time searching\
    \ for the things you need. Try cleaning and organizing your work environment to\
    \ improve efficiency.\n\n24. **Tune Your Intrinsic Motivation**: If you don't\
    \ love what you do, you're less likely to be productive. Try to find something\
    \ exciting or exciting about your work or project and focus on it.\n\n25. **Build\
    \ a Rhythm**: If you find yourself working inconsistently\u2014too much one day\
    \ and then doing nothing\u2014try establishing a regular rhythm for yourself.\
    \ For example, you can schedule certain hours of each day or week for work and\
    \ others for leisure or personal matters.\n\n26. **Practice Your Communication**:\
    \ Good communication skills can help avoid underperformance due to misunderstandings\
    \ or conflicts. Try improving your communication skills through training, practice,\
    \ or consultation.\n\n27. **Practice Critical Thinking**: Critical thinking will\
    \ help you avoid unproductive activities and reduce the time you spend on them.\
    \ Try to analyze each task or process to find ways to improve or optimize it.\n\
    \n28. **Evaluate Results**: Remember to check what you have achieved at the end\
    \ of each project or period of work. If you're not efficient enough or simply\
    \ spend too much time on certain tasks, you may need to change your approach or\
    \ find a better way to complete them.\n\n29. **Use the Wait**: If you often find\
    \ yourself waiting - at a reception, in a queue or during negotiations, do not\
    \ forget that this time can be used effectively. For example, you can solve simple\
    \ problems or do something to develop your skills.\n\n30. **Page Projects**: If\
    \ you have some page projects that you are interested in but are not part of your\
    \ day job, try setting aside a specific time for them. This can help avoid transitions\
    \ from one context to another and reduce distancing.\n\n31. **Practice chunking**:\
    \ Breaking down into smaller tasks or steps can help avoid transitions from one\
    \ activity to another and reduce distancing. It may seem like a very complex task,\
    \ but if it is divided into many smaller parts, then it can become feasible.\n\
    \n32. **Practice Analytical Thinking**: Analytical thinking helps you find the\
    \ best ways to complete tasks or processes, which can reduce the time you spend\
    \ completing them. Try to understand the details of each task or process to find\
    \ possible improvements.\n\n33. **Practise Planning**: Planning is one of the\
    \ key aspects of effective time management. Try to develop your own scheduling\
    \ system that works for you, or try out different scheduling apps and methods.\n\
    \n34. **Study the Economics of Time**: Understanding the economics of time can\
    \ help identify those tasks or processes that are best to invest time in and those\
    \ that should be given less attention. This can help reduce wasted time on ineffective\
    \ tasks.\n\n35. **Learn new things**: Don't stick to one method or tool if it\
    \ doesn't work for you. Learn new methods and technologies that can help improve\
    \ your efficiency.\n\n36. **Customize Your Environment**: Your desk or office\
    \ is an important part of your work environment that can affect your productivity.\
    \ Try to customize them so that they are as convenient as possible for you.\n\n\
    37. **Ask Yourself Questions**: While working on any task or project, don't hesitate\
    \ to ask yourself: \u201CWhat am I doing?\u201D, \u201CIs this the right direction?\u201D\
    , \u201CIs there a better way?\u201D This can help you avoid unproductive actions\
    \ and find optimal ways to perform.\n\n38. **Study Psychology**: Psychology can\
    \ help you understand how you can better work with yourself to improve your performance.\
    \ For example, by studying the theory of motivation, you can find what really\
    \ makes you move forward and devote more time to it.\n\n39. **Learn the skills\
    \ of compromise**: Compromise is a necessary part of any project or process, so\
    \ it is important to develop your skills in this direction. This can help avoid\
    \ bottlenecks due to demands on quality or deadlines. Which one is better suited\
    \ for you.\n\n40. **Practice abbreviation**: Abbreviation is a key skill for effective\
    \ time management, as it helps you avoid wasting time on minor details or transitions.\
    \ Try practicing shortening texts, materials or processes.\n\n41. **Learn Technology**:\
    \ Technology can help you with planning, organization, communications, and even\
    \ the very concept of efficiency. Don't be stuck with what you have, try new things\
    \ - it can greatly improve your performance.\n\n42. **Create control systems**:\
    \ Control systems are an important tool for effective time management as they\
    \ help prevent confusion or unproductive work. Maybe you need to introduce some\
    \ procedures, techniques or tools to control your work.\n\n43. **Practice division**:\
    \ Dividing into small tasks or steps can help avoid transitions from one context\
    \ to another and reduce distancing. It may seem like a very complex task, but\
    \ if it is divided into many smaller parts, then it can become feasible.\n\n44.\
    \ **Study the psychology of communication**: Good communication skills can help\
    \ avoid conflicts or decreased productivity due to misunderstandings. Try studying\
    \ the psychology of communication to develop your skills in this area.\n\n45.\
    \ **Ask for Help**: Don't let pride stop you from asking for help when you're\
    \ struggling with something. Many people would be happy to help, and this can\
    \ greatly speed up the process of learning or solving a problem.\n\n46. **Practise\
    \ Analysis**: Analytical thinking is a key component of effective time management,\
    \ as it helps you find the best ways to complete tasks or processes. Try to analyze\
    \ your work processes and eliminate possible shortcomings in them.\n\n47. **Try\
    \ to stay active**: This can mean not only physical activity, but also intellectual\
    \ activity - reading, discussing, solving problems, or simply thinking about a\
    \ topic that interests you. This can help avoid transitions into unproductive\
    \ rest.\n\n// LOOP STARTED****************************\n\n48. **Practice Critical\

    \ setting it up to be as comfortable as possible for you.\n\n50. **Measure Results**:\

    \ allows you to identify those tasks or processes where you can be more effective\
    \ and those that need less attention.\n\n51. **Explore Mental Abilities**: Some\
    \ people have natural talents or mental abilities that can help them in their\
