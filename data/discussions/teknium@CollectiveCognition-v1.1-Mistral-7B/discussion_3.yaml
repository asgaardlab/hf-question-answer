        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Would it be possible for you to upload qlora adapter files in the main
          model repos or in separate model repo to make it more accessible for people
          with poor internet to try out your models? Someone could download base model
          and merge your qloras on their own to save on bandwidth. I specifically
          would like to check out this model and the airoboros 2.2 mistral qlora but
          waiting for 26GB download to finish would be a day long undertaking, while
          I could download and merge those qloras in half an hour. </p>
