        html: '<p>Hello, I''ve seen some feedback here and there, the main issue as
          I saw was that the model was overbaked with p*rn (while still being able
          to talk normally), and finish story/sexual act for the user.</p>

          <p>My goal was first to uncensor all the shit you degen (and myself heheh)
          are able to think about, and it worked, thus having the secret recipe and
          each step of it saved, I can clearly modify what''s in it.</p>

          <p>Do you have suggestion of model with good dataset I could add in it ?
          Maybe a request to make it act differently ?<br>Post it here. </p>

          <p>Also, there 3 variant of this model and I suggest you to try them (015
          / 050). Finding the magic sauce is hard bros, but I will smash it.</p>

          <p>In V2.2, pyg2 will be less present, pyg2 have a lot of good data in it
          but have a censoring side too, I tested, and in the most degen thing 2/10
          reply was censored, softly but it was.<br>Please be patient with me, I take
          6h of sleep and 18h of rocksmashing model per day to try to find the magic
          touch kek</p>
