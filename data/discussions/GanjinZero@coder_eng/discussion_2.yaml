        html: '<p>Hello and thanks for making this available. I am not sure if I''m
          interpreting how to use this best or not. Let''s say for the sake of argument
          I have many roughly one sentence long descriptions of lab tests I would
          like to cluster. So they may have different names but relate to similar
          underlying conditions. Feeding sample text to the hosted model I get multiple
          results vs a single vector, does this (loosely?) correlate to ''medical
          concepts''? Could said vectors be summed and fed downstream to a clustering
          process or would that not be advisable?</p>
