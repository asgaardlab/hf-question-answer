        html: '<p>I found frostwind a little dry prose wise. The brand new nous hermes
          solar 10.7 fine tune is better. I like this idea though, mixing a franken
          merge with noromaid in it, with solar instruct.</p>

          <p>Perhaps you could share the full model? (not safetensors as I can''t
          use those). I''d love to play with further merging this myself!</p>

        html: '<p>I tried this out BTW. It''s good. Not as coherent/smart as frostwind
          but a tonne better prose. Despite a little incoherency, probably the best
          prose I''ve seen in a solar instruct model.  I found it more descriptive
          at times than noromaid 20b, mistral small or even the 8x7b noromaid finetune
          of mistral small. </p>

          <p>Makes me wonder about squeezing a gentle gradient merge in there somehow.
          Maybe nous hermes slerped into frostwind (which is very smart but dry),
          and dropped back in with a subtle 70-80% at the bottom layer up to 0% at
          1/3 through just to pump some instruct/logic back into it? Or 50% through
          the layers?</p>

          <p>Just needs something to nudge it back in the direction of a bit better
          coherency I thing, without ruining the nice prose potion.</p>
