        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Seem there is another work that also made by the PKU called Video-LLaVA
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/LanguageBind/Video-LLaVA-V1.5/tree/main">https://huggingface.co/LanguageBind/Video-LLaVA-V1.5/tree/main</a></p>

          <p>Although weight not release yet, but it seems surpass chat univi in all
          benchmarks</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-LLaVA#video-understanding">https://github.com/PKU-YuanGroup/Video-LLaVA#video-understanding</a></p>

          <p>Some both methods added video unserstanding to LLM, and both methods
          can process video &amp; image simulnatenously. It is just that ChatUniVi
          has invented another apoproach that is different from LLaVA, where Video-LLaVA
          has derived from? Is there anything that make these two methods fundamentally
          different?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
