        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Firstly, I want to extend my gratitude for your incredible work in the
          field of open-source NLP. Your contributions have been invaluable to the
          community.</p>

          <p>I am reaching out to inquire if you could provide the zero-shot script
          used for testing the Jais-30B-chat model on MMLU-like Arabic datasets. I''ve
          been attempting to use the model for multiple-choice questions, but unfortunately,
          my attempts result in responses such as, "I''m sorry, I cannot provide the
          correct answer to multiple-choice questions. " For reference, I am using
          the ''prompt_ar'' provided on your hf platform.</p>

          <p>Additionally, I have another question regarding benchmark assessments
          for multiple-choice questions. When you conduct these benchmark evaluations,
          is the ''config'' also set with ''do_sample=true''?</p>

          <p>Any guidance or information you can provide would be greatly appreciated.</p>

          <p>Best regards,</p>
