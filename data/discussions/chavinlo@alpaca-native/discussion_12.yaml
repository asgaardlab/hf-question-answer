        html: '<p>If I wanted to fine-tune a model like 13b with a different dataset,
          would I just point to the 13b folder with the consolidated.00.pth and consolidated.01.pth
          files? The thing I''m unsure about is whether it''ll work with the model
          being split into two parts. Also, I read about needing hf converted model
          files. How do I do that?</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
