          <p>The latest checkpoint is 800/1200, I would continue training but it''s
          simply too slow (60s/it) for some reason. If anybody has a solution to this
          problem let me know, I would be happy to let these 4xA100 continue working
          or even train larger models such as 30B with more gpus. More info: <a rel="nofollow"
