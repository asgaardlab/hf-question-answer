        html: '<p>I fused the lcm-lora into the model in Civitai, then fused my own
          trained LoRa. There is a noticeable difference in the effect of fusing my
          own LoRa directly on Civitai compared to fusing it after lcm-lora. The original
          direct fusion of my own LoRa has a more distinct style, while the difference
          in styles between different LoRas seems to decrease after fusing with lcm-lora.
          Is this due to the combination of multiple LoRas, or is it a problem with
