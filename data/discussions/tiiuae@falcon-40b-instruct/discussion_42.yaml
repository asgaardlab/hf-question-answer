          Your assignment involves the following steps:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Consider the given dialog between a human and an assistant, and think
          of an assistant response in the conversation.</li>

          <li>Now, envision what followup question would help the human to continue
          having an engaging conversation.</li>

          <li>Write followup questions that human may ask the assistant in the conversation.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>The goal is to provide enough detail in your followup questions so that

          <li>Be as specific as possible in your followup questions. Vague or generic

          <li>Make sure each question is independently complete and there is no use
