        html: '<p>The description for Falcon-40B-Instruct states:</p>

          <p>This is an instruct model, which may not be ideal for further finetuning.
          If you are interested in building your own instruct/chat model, we recommend
          starting from Falcon-40B.</p>

          <p>Why is this the case? I have my own domain-specific chatbot use case.
          Since my use case is still a chatbot (just with additional domain-specific
          context on how to respond added in during fine-tuning), wouldn''t it make
          more sense to finetune Falcon-40B-Instruct, which has already learned basic
          chatbot capabilities.</p>
