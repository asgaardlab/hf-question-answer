          </code></pre>\n<p>However, the moment I add some sort of formatting instructions\
          \ into the mix, these seem to get ignored. Some examples:\"cite the Document[number]\
          \ which your answer was generated from\"  (what I'm actually trying)  but\
          \ also simple ones like \"add YO at the end of each sentence\" or \"End\
