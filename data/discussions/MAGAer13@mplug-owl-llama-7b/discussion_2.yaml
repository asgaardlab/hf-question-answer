        html: '<p>Hi there.<br>Your model is really cool. I have added it to lollms
          so that people can use it to interact with images.<br>But I don''t have
          a big GPU and it is making my GPU suffer.<br>I wonder if it is in anysense
          possible to quantize the model to 4bits using GPTQ? I know it is possible
          with llama models.<br>Best regards</p>
