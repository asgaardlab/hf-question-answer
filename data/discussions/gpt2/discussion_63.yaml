        html: '<p>Hi everyone.</p>

          <p>I want to use gpt2 for sentiment classification using a few-shot approach
          (see screenshot). I need just one word to be generated either positive or
          negative. Using the inference API on the website works well, but I find
          replicating it difficult. What happens behind the scene? I am using GPT2LMHeadModel,
          GPT2Tokenizer and the forward() method. Also, inference time seems much
          faster online than locally.</p>

          <p>Any help is well appreciated. Thank you</p>
