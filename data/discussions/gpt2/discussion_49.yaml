        html: '<p>My goal is to fine-tune a model by training it on synthetic company
          data in the form of text reports, i.e. monthly/weekly reports about the
          company''s performance</p>

          <p>I then want to be able to prompt the model with questions such as "What
          are the company''s biggest weaknesses?" or "What should the company''s strategy
          be for next month?". So I want the fine-tuned model to be able to act as
          an advisor to the company given its understanding of the company''s reports/performance</p>

          <p>Given that my company report data is a load of text files, what is the
          best way to structure it for my use case? Can I simply train the model on
          a multiple text strings, should I convert it into question-answer pairs,
          a combination of strings and pairs, or do you suggest another approach?</p>
