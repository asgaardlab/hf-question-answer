        html: '<p>My objective is to fine-tune a model on data about Manchester United''s
          (MU''s) 2021/22 season. I want to be able to prompt the fine-tuned model

          weaknesses?"</p>

          <p>What data should I train the model on? Should it just be a long string
          of text which details MU''s season, a list of question-answer pairs - e.g.  "prompt":
          "What could Manchester United do to better manage unexpected changes such
          as player loans or COVID-19 disruptions?", "completion": "To better manage
          unexpected changes, Manchester United could invest in contingency planning,
          including having backup players ready for loan situations, and ensuring
          strict health protocols to minimize COVID-19 disruptions. Rigorous planning
          and flexibility can help the team adapt to changing circumstances. - a combination
          of both, or should I structure my data in another way?</p>
