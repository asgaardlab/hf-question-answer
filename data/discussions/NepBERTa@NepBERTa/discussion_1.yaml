        html: '<p>System details:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Python 3.11.5</li>

          <li>Transformers 4.35.2</li>

          <li>Torch 2.1.1</li>

          </ul>

          <p>When I try to load the NepBERTa model by running the command:<br><code>from
          transformers import AutoModelForMaskedLM</code><br><code>model = AutoModelForMaskedLM.from_pretrained("NepBERTa/NepBERTa")</code></p>

          <p>I get the following error:<br><em>"OSError: NepBERTa/NepBERTa does not
          appear to have a file named pytorch_model.bin but there is a file for TensorFlow
          weights. Use <code>from_tf=True</code> to load this model from those weights."</em></p>

          <p>It seems like there''s a version mismatch and I might need to downgrade
          torch but I am not sure to which version as I can''t find any relevant docs
          anywhere. Can someone help?</p>
