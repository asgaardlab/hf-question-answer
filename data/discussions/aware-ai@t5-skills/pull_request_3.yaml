        raw: 'This pull request aims to enrich the metadata of your model by adding
          [`flozi00/t5-skills`](https://huggingface.co/flozi00/t5-skills) as a `base_model`

          How did we find this information? We performed a regular expression match
          on your `README.md` file to determine the connection.


          **Why add this?** Enhancing your model''s metadata in this way:

          - **Boosts Discoverability** - It becomes straightforward to trace the relationships
          between various models on the Hugging Face Hub.

          - **Highlights Impact** - It showcases the contributions and influences
          different models have within the community.

          model connections, take a look at [librarian-bots/base_model_explorer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/librarian-bots/base_model_explorer).
