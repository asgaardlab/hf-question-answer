          <p>Hello Crestfall, sorry for the late reply.</p>

          <p>I''ve played with both these last few days, they''re quite similar overall.<br>Crestfall-Toppy-Rats-M-7B:
          Has more quirks, nothing too grand nor bad per se.<br>Crestfall-Toppy-M-7b:
          Is similar enough that the majority of users wouldn''t even notice any difference,
          at least not when it comes to RP~ERP, although the Toppy-Rats-M-7B seems
          to have a bit more vocabulary on it in very specific scenarios (which doesn''t
          necessarily means a plus, it''s specific enough) </p>

          <p>My verdict would be that they''re similar enough, meaning that they''re
          both good, you probably did well onto pulling the other merge out.</p>

          <p>My settings goes has follow:<br>KoboldCPP = Min-P (0.05-0.1 depending
          on my objective with the writing.) Temperature (1.6-2.0 in accordance to
          my Min-P value, also depending on my objective.) Standard value is 0.05
          and 1.6.<br>Every other sampling method disabled (Top-p, Top-K, Top-A, Typ.,
          TFS, Mirostat) including Repetition Penalty which I only enable when necessary.</p>

    \ enough that the majority of users wouldn't even notice any difference, at least\
    \ not when it comes to RP~ERP, although the Toppy-Rats-M-7B seems to have a bit\
    \ more vocabulary on it in very specific scenarios (which doesn't necessarily\
    \ means a plus, it's specific enough) \n\nMy verdict would be that they're similar\
    \ enough, meaning that they're both good, you probably did well onto pulling the\
    \ other merge out.\n\nMy settings goes has follow:\nKoboldCPP = Min-P (0.05-0.1\
    \ depending on my objective with the writing.) Temperature (1.6-2.0 in accordance\
    \ to my Min-P value, also depending on my objective.) Standard value is 0.05 and\
    \ 1.6.\nEvery other sampling method disabled (Top-p, Top-K, Top-A, Typ., TFS,\
    \ Mirostat) including Repetition Penalty which I only enable when necessary."
