          \ War I, also known as the Great War, was a global military conflict that\
          \ took place from 1914 to 1918. It was one of the largest and most destructive\
          \ wars in history, with over 9 million combat dead and millions more wounded\
          \ or displaced. The war began after an Austria-Hungary (A-H) ultimatum to\
          \ Serbia, which demanded that they relinquish their hold on Bosnia and Herzegovina.\
          \ This was denied, and A-H declared war on Serbia.\nAs a result of the Allies,\
          \ this triggered Germany's entry into the fray. In 1917, Russia (the most\
          \ powerful of the Allies) left the fray because of the Bolshevik Revolution,\
          \ and the United States entered the fray in 1917 as well. This led to an\
          \ armistice on the Western Front and a truce on all fronts. In 1918, Germany\
          \ signed for no reason but surrender, and the war ended\n\nWorld War I (WWI)\
          \ was one of the deadliest conflicts in history. It resulted in over 40\
          \ million casualties, including more than 15 million deaths due to starvation,\
          \ disease, and combat. The Central Powers included Germany, Austria-Hungary,\
          \ Bulgaria, and the Ottoman Empire, while the Allies were France, Great\
          \ Britain, Russia, Italy, and the United States.\n\nThe war began in the\
          \ summer of 1914 when one of these countries (Austria-Hungary) declared\
          \ war on a small one (Serbia). Germany sided with Austria-Hungary after\
          \ realizing that they were about to get attacked. The Allies (the British,\
          \ French, Russian and Americans) responded by declaring war on the Central\

          \ Russia declared war on Germany. Britain and its allies promised to make\

          \ Central Powers, which included Germany, Austria-Hungary, Bulgaria, and\
          \ the Ottoman Empire. The Allies' war plans were to knock out the German\
