        html: '<p>This discussion was created to request the creation of the Tensorflow
          Class ''TFGPTNeoModel''.</p>

          <p>I would like help in converting to TensorFlow format for further analysis
          and use in a TensorFlow-based application. I understand that converting
          a PyTorch model to TensorFlow format can be a challenging task, and it requires
          a thorough understanding of both frameworks. However, I believe that this
          conversion would be beneficial in terms of using the PyTorch model in a
          TensorFlow-based application and to the TensorFlow community.<br>Therefore,
          I kindly request your support in converting the PyTorch model into TensorFlow
          format. I would greatly appreciate your expertise in this matter and any
          guidance you can provide.<br>Thank you for your time and consideration.
          I look forward to hearing from you soon.<br>Sincerely,<br>William.</p>
