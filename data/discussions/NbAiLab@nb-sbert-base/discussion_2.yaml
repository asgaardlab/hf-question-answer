        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>First of all great job on this sBERT model! </p>

          <p>Secondly, it looks like something weird is going on with the <code>model_max_length</code>
          and <code>max_seq_length</code> attributes when instantiating the model
          via <code>AutoModel</code> / <code>AutoTokenizer</code> and <code>SentenceTransformer</code>,
          respectively.</p>

          <p>The sentence-transformers implementation gives a max length of 75:</p>

          <pre><code>model_st = SentenceTransformer(''NbAiLab/nb-sbert-base'')

          model_st.max_seq_length


          # 75

          </code></pre>

          <p>While loading the tokenizer through HF''s AutoTokenizer gives a very
          different max length: </p>

          <pre><code>model = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(''NbAiLab/nb-sbert-base'')

          tokenizer.model_max_length


          # 1000000000000000019884624838656

          </code></pre>

          <p>The second one is clearly incorrect, but is 75 the correct max sequence
          length for this model? If I remember correctly, BERT models have a sequence
          length of 512, or has that changed when finetuning this model?</p>

          <p>This also means for sequences longer than 75, both implementations will
          give different embeddings, which may be worth mentioning.</p>
