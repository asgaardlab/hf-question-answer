        html: '<p>Hello, thanks for this great model! I''ve been running a couple
          dozen tests and the image outputs are great. Only thing I can''t seem to
          fix is the duplication of the subject in question. For instance "astronaut
          standing on the beach" almost always generates two astronauts. Even typing
          "single astronaut" or "one astronaut" doesn''t seem to change anything.
          This seems to be the case with about 90% of the prompts I''ve used.<br>Any
          ideas on a prompt that would solve this? </p>
