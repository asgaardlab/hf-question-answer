        html: '<p>Hello. I just wan''t to make sure I understood everything correctly
          when reading the GitHub PR comments. The Q5_K_M is not implemented yet,
          right? If so that''s unfortunate, because I have all my GGUF models in Q5_K_M,
          but with how efficient Mixtral is supposed to be I''ll manage with Q6_K.</p>

          <p>On a sidenote. Thank you very much for your work! I love playing with
          new technologies and with my hardware limitations it wouldn''t be possible
          without your quick and consistent work. I wish you all the best!</p>

          <p>GGeorganov said earlier that for Mixtral the _S and _L sizes are currently
          identical to the _M size.  And the Q4_K_M is the same size (but not the
          same content) as Q4_0 and likewise Q5_K_M is same size (but different content)
