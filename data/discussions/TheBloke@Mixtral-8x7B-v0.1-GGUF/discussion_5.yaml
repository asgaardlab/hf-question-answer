          \ leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room? Explain your reasoning\
          \ step by step.\n\nThere is only 1 killer in the room, as someone entered\
          \ the room and killed one of the three original killers, thus reducing the\
          \ number of killers in the room to two (the remaining two original killers\
          \ plus the person who entered the room and killed one of the three original\
          \ killers). The person who entered the room and killed one of the three\
          \ original killers cannot be considered a killer as they were not already\
          \ present within the room prior to having murdered one of the three original\
          \ killers.\n\n\n&gt; If I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground\
          \ to dry and it takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take\
          \ to dry 4 shirts of the same type that way simultanously?\n\nThe answer\
          \ to this question is that it would take a total of ten (10) hours for all\
          \ four (4) shirts to be fully dried out in the sun if they were all laid\
          \ out flat on the ground at the same time. This can be determined by looking\
          \ at the given information and comparing it with what we know about drying\
          \ wet clothing items in direct sunlight outside when placed down onto a\
          \ hard surface such as pavement or concrete so that air can flow through\
          \ them unimpeded which helps speed up their evaporation rate thus allowing\
          \ for faster overall total time spent drying out before reaching full dryness\
          \ status again. The reason why it would take twice (2x) as long to fully\
          \ dry four (4) shirts laid down flat on the ground all at once is because\
          \ when two (2) wet items are placed together side by side, they will absorb\
          \ moisture from one another causing them both become slightly damp instead\
          \ remaining completely soaked through with liquid until reaching complete\
          \ dryness status again. This process known as capillary action due its ability\
          \ move small amounts liquids up against gravity forces using nothing more\
          \ than surface tension properties alone making it incredibly useful tool\
          \ engineers scientists when designing complex machinery systems requiring\
          \ precise control over fluid flow dynamics within tightly confined spaces\

          \ Since nobody left the room after someone entered, it means that all three\

          \ to the question would be \"three killers are still alive in the room\"\
          \ because we know that one of them was killed but then they were not removed\

    \ us eight so now we can subtract five from twenty-five resulting in nineteen\
    \ as our answer before finally adding three onto this number thus making it 22\
    \ points total!\n\n ###\n> If I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground\
    \ to dry and it takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take to dry\
    \ 4 shirts of the same type that way simultanously?\nTo determine this answer\
    \ we must first consider if there is any difference between each piece being dried\
    \ simultaneously or not; then look at factors such as temperature and humidity\
    \ levels which can affect drying time. If it's assumed both types of clothing\
    \ will require similar amounts based off their weight/size etcetera, 5 hours for\
    \ one shirt should equate roughly around 10-12 hours when laid out together given\
    \ equal conditions applied throughout (which may vary depending on where you live).\n\
