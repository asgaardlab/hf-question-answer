          <p>About this model in specific, which version of Noromaid was used, 0.1.1
          or 0.2? I assume it was 0.2 but the models name says "v0.1".<br>Also, if
          I must say and then ask, I had a very good experience with the Toppy-Mix-4x7B.Q4_K_M
          model, would you be able to maybe pump more 4x7B models in the near future?
          I say this because, 8x7B is borderline unusable for me (and for a lot of
          people, which has poor hardware, like me.) simply too big I am afraid.</p>

        html: '<p>The main 2 people working on the models here are Undi and me. We
          named the model 0.1 because this is not "based" on neither 0.1/0.1.1 or
          0.2, this is completely different so it got a different versioning.</p>

          <p>You sadly can''t apply Loras(which we used with this version) to any
          other models than 8x7b, as 4x7b and so on are kind of Frankenmerges. <em><strong>This
          could be wrong, i''ll need for undi to wake up to confirm this.</strong></em><br>But
          we are happy to tell you that a new version is in the mkaing, the new version
          should solve some of the formatting issues this current model has, still
          8x7b though.</p>

          <p>Thanks for your praise, we always hope to bring you guys the best models
          possible with our tools!</p>
