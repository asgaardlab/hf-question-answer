        html: '<p>Hey Brandon,</p>

          <p>airoboros-33b-gpt4-1.4.1-NTK-16384-fp16 should be fully usable with proper
          GGML quantization now, and I''d be curious to convert it in GGUF to play
          with it, and compare it with the LXCTX-PI which is still one of my daily
          use model with Airoboros C34 2.1. But the FP16 link gives a 404. Could you
          share it again, please?</p>
