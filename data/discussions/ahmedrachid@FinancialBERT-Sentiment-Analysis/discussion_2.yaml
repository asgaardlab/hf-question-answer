        html: '<p>I ran the classifier on the headlines of today''s Financial Times
          and got several classifications that seem odd:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Bangladesh seeks IMF loan as rising import bills hit South Asia: positive</li>

          <li>European gas price rise accelerates as Russia cuts flows: positive</li>

          <li>Italian companies braced for more political uncertainty: neutral</li>

          </ul>

          <p>For both the "rising import bills" and the "gas price rise" I guess it
          latched on to "rising" as something good, whereas in fact it''s a negative
          for the overall economy. I wonder if the FT titles are just out of distribution
          or more fine-tuning is needed.</p>

          <p>Another interesting case is "Rates dropped for the first time since early
          July, though they are still up significantly this year." which is rated
          strongly negative, but interest rates dropping is a good sign for the overall
          economy.</p>
