          has code for it. Annoyingly I could only get it to work by letting it download
          the model from hf, and it wouldn''t use my downloaded one, but from the
          <code>scripts</code> folder in that repo (after doing <code>make</code>,
          probably):<br><code>python ./convert_gptneox_to_ggml.py rinna/japanese-gpt-neox-3.6b-instruction-ppo
          ./out</code></p>

          <p>You can run it using <code>./main-gptneox</code> (<code>./main</code>
          does not work as it is still the llama format).</p>
