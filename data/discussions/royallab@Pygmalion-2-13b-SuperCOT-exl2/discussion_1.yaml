        html: '<p>Yeah, I''m sure quite a few people with obsolete GPUs would appreciate
          2 or 3 bit variants of 13b models. I have a 3060, so the 4 and 5 bit variations
          offered here work fine for me, but I''m salivating over the idea of running
          a 2-bit frankensteined 22b model. Wherever people happen to fall on the
          spectrum, it seems these exl2 variants allow them to go way higher than
          before. Very exciting times!</p>
