        html: '<p>Hi Kaikai, great work, however, I am not really able to run it or
          I''m not sure I''m doing that right.</p>

          <p>pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(<br>    pretrained_model_name_or_path,<br>    torch_dtype=torch.float16<br>).to("cuda")  </p>

          <p>gives an error, so I had to add low_cpu_mem_usage=False to it. Then it
          runs but the results are not equal to the ones you are getting here. Any
          ideas ? </p>

        html: '<p>Hi Mousey,<br>thanks for asking. From the infomation given, I can''t
          really tell what''s going wrong. Usually, the problem has to do with memory.
          But, if you can run the model, I suspect the problem has to do with the
          prompt. Did you use the template keywords before and after in the prompt?</p>
