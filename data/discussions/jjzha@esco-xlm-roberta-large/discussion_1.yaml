        html: '<p>Hello, the purpose of this model is to make it work better for NLP
          tasks in the job market domain. I mostly benchmarked it on sequence labeling
          tasks within the job market domain (e.g., job postings) as you can read

          <p>You could possibly implement this for job matching, maybe you could get
          encode the data with this model to get the dense representations and use
          them in your downstream job matching application.</p>
