          I wanted to ask you, wouldn''t it be possible to make another model of this
          one but from 0.4b or lower? The thing is that although I manage to run it
          on my 4Gb RAM cell phone, it crashes shortly after and I can no longer run
          it. I think that with a 0.4b one like the original RWKV World I would do
          better. Thank you for creating this model, it is a great advance for cell
