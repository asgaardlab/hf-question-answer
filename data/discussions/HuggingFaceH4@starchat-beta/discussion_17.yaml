        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>after reading the paper published on StarCoder model (basis for StarChat),
          it seems to me that the training data does not differentiate among various
          SQL dialects. </p>

          <p>With that in mind, my question is:</p>

          <p>Can the StarChat model be used to efficiently translate stored SQL procedures
          from one dialect to another (e.g. MS SQL Server to PostgreSQL)? </p>

          <p>Does anyone have any experience with this type of usage?</p>
