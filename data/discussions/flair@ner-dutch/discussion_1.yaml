        html: '<p>I encounter an issue when using this model as a NER classifier.
          Some words are not recognized and throw an index error. I suspect this has
          something to do with the word embeddings. For example the sentence: mr Frank
          visser is een man. Doesn''t work however Mr Frank Visser does work. This
          is strange because I thought flair used character embeddings and thus worked
          with every word. </p>
