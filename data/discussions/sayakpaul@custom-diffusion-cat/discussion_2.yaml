        html: '<p>Thanks for simple code arrangement! </p>

          <p>your code is much simple than official code using diffusers. </p>

          <p>So I wonder:<br>    What was reference images?  &amp;<br>    Did you
          tried multiple concept using your code? </p>

          <p>I start this discussion because I fallow your instruction with multiple
          concept with no regularization but I cant see any consistancy with reference
          image..</p>
