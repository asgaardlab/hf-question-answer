        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for putting this together, with a few updates here and there I''ve
          managed to get it working however I''m having issues with the contrast of
          the output images increasing as the sequence progresses.  I think I read
          someone else having the same problem.  Do you have any ideas?</p>

          <p>Interestingly, I had the same problem with the v1 temporalnet which didn''t
          us the oflow maps.  it could very well be something I''m not doing right
          on my end.  Any help would be appreciated!</p>

          <p>Thank you<br>Jase</p>

          I think the bugs stem from it being based on an older commit of the original
          controlnet code.  Bound to happen when things are moving as quickly as they
          are right now.
