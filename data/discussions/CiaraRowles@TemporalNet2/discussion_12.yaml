          the instructions, and if I run the script for few minutes, almost melting
          my computer, I outputed the two first frames of my animation andit gives

          <p>here, the first image is roughly what I asked, but the second frame already
          have pretty strong inconsistencies, even on some areas that are not moving

          <p>To compare, here is a gif of the output with the first version of temporalnet.
          Even tho it''s already pretty cool, consistency definitely could be improved<br><a

          <p>Is there any chance to have an update that''d make it easier to use?
          An extension for the webUI version would be so awesome, making it easy to
