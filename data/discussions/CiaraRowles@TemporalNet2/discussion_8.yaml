        html: '<p>No matter what I try, I see no branches and can''t do any git checkout
          commands to switch branches, without errors like "Error: pathspec ''<a rel="nofollow"

          did not match any file(s) known to git" - either from trying to switch my
          old sd-webui-controlnet to TemporalNet, or (after having cloned TemporalNet
          separately) trying to switch it to TemporalKit/tree/TemporalNet. </p>

          <p>Could you put the below into a plain-English series of git commands?  Because
          I (and ChatGPT, for that matter  ;)  ) am stumped as to what series of steps
          you want taken.</p>

          <p>========<br>This took some modification of the original controlnet code
          so you''ll have to do some extra things. If you just want to run a gradio
          example or look at the modified controlnet code, that''s here: <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalNet">https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalNet</a>
          Just drop the model from this directory into that model folder and make
          sure the gradio_temporalnet.py script points at the model.</p>

          <p>To use with stable diffusion, you can either use it with TemporalKit
          by moving to the branch here after following steps 1 and 2: <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalKit/tree/TemporalNet">https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalKit/tree/TemporalNet</a>
          , or use it just by accessing the base api through the temporalvideo.py
          script:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>move your controlnet webui install to this branch: <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API">https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API</a><br>.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>========</p>

          <p>(I''m wanting to try this branch because I tried the old TemporalNet
          script, and all I got was completely random images with zero consistency.  I''d
          ideally like to work within Gradio rather than having to run with a script,
          if that''s possible)</p>

          <p>Oh, and on that note: "and make sure the gradio_temporalnet.py script
          points at the model." - when I cloned TemporalNet, the directory I got has
          nothing called "gradio_temporalnet.py".  Nor is it even clear what you mean
          by "that model folder".  From the AUTOMATIC1111 directory, do you mean models/Stable-diffusion,
          models/ControlNet, or extensions/sd-webui-controlnet[-TemporalNet-API]/models?</p>

          <p>Lastly, is EBSynth required for this?  As a Linux user, when I search
          for EBSynth, the overwhelming majority of hits are some Windows GUI program
          (and in your tutorial, you appear to show a Windows GUI program).  I tried
          this:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/jamriska/ebsynth.git">https://github.com/jamriska/ebsynth.git</a></p>

          <p>... but all the results I''ve gotten from it are garbage... so juddery
          it''s just best to skip it altogether and deal with StableDiffusion''s flicker.

          are struggling. Here''s the actual process for getting this to work.</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Backup / uninstall your old controlNET version.</li>

          <li>Install this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API">https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API</a>
          using web ui</li>

          <li>Install this <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalNet">https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalNet</a>
          using web ui</li>

          <li>Download the model, the model .yaml, and the temporalnedvideo.py from
          this model card</li>

          <li>Put model and the yaml file inside of your new stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API\models</li>

          <li>Make sure you have openpose1.1 and hed1.1 also installed into this new
          model folder - you can grab it from your old controlnet folder.</li>

          <li>Make sure you have model caching disabled.  If you had it enabled in
          your old controlNET settings, it will bomb out when you go to run this.

          1) Backup / uninstall your old controlNET version.

          2) Install this https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API
          using web ui

          3) Install this https://github.com/CiaraStrawberry/TemporalNet using web
          ui

          4) Download the model, the model .yaml, and the temporalnedvideo.py from
          this model card

          5) Put model and the yaml file inside of your new stable-diffusion-webui\extensions\sd-webui-controlnet-TemporalNet-API\models

          6) Make sure you have openpose1.1 and hed1.1 also installed into this new
          model folder - you can grab it from your old controlnet folder.

          7) Make sure you have model caching disabled.  If you had it enabled in
          your old controlNET settings, it will bomb out when you go to run this.
          You may need to go directly into the line in the script that''s failing
          and set MODEL_CACHES = 0

          8) Fully restart your web ui

          9) Put temporalvideo.py into a new directory of your choosing and open it
          in the editor.  In the arg parse section at the top, replace everything
          with your proper input, output, and init img file locations.

          10) Run temporalvideo.py using the same python distro that you run stable
          diffusion with.  Very important for windows users with WSL or pycharm, etc.  If
          you have multiple python installs, only the one that has

          all the packages installed for SD is going to work to run this.

          <p>Where can I find hed 1.1? The only version I can find is the 1.0 one:
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/models/control_sd15_hed.pth">https://huggingface.co/lllyasviel/ControlNet/blob/main/models/control_sd15_hed.pth</a></p>

          <p>Or should I use control_v11p_sd15_scribble.pth with the scribble_hed
          preprocessor?</p>
