          If anyone knows of other SDXL controlnets let me know, would really like
          a normalebae that 1.5 had.

          I will also throw out, I''ve had serious issue with generation speeds especially
          while running multi controlnets on newer Nvidia drivers, I use 531.79 now
          and there are no issues.

          Thanks again for the training, Ciara!
