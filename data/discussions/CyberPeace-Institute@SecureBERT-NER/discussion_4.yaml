        html: '<p>Hello,<br>First of all, thank you very much for sharing such a concentrated
          of great achievements.</p>

          <p>I was wondering about your take concerning the way to deal with an expansion
          of the vocabulary at no cost, especially the V_{distinct} set (referring
          to the $4 of the introducing paper). Indeed, CTI possess these specifics
          that other specialized fields do not: the expanding - or even moving (like
          an average) - actual vocabulary due to the evolution of the threat landscape
          at the tactical level : new (dubbed) malware, threat actors, campaigns,
          tools, intrusion sets, etc.<br>The contextual nature of BERT could of course
          render objective embeddings, but even the possibility to generate those
          embeddings is conditionned to a suitable "basis" in the vocabulary.</p>

          <p>What is your say about it ? Which solution ?</p>
