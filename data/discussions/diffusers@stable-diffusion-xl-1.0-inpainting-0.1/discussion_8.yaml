        html: '<p>Hi Everyone!</p>

          <p>I just started using it and the results are great! However, it has one
          big issue: It''s hard to remove a big object out of the input. Let''s say
          I want to empty a room, instead, it will keep throwing random asterisks
          into the input.</p>

          <p>Any ideas how to implement or setting the parameters to achieve this?</p>
