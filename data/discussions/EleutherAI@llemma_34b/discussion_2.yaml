          <p>Sort of , I was using an OCR to LaTeX program but it had a lot of extra
          syntax for formatting and I think that was throwing the model off.  I had
          another AI simplify the LaTeX (I am currently very poor in LaTeX) and my
          instructions to the AI were not so great so it outputted a quasi-LaTeX output,
          was not properly formatted for rendering.  The llemma model seemed to have
          figured it out though, and gave me a properly formatted LaTeX output.  I''m
          going to do more testing today, but I think the best way to send equations
          to the model is via simple LaTeX formatting, avoiding stuff like specific
          fonts or other extra formatting LaTeX code. </p>
