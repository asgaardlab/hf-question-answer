          corruption as the base infill objective following InCoder (Fried et al.,
          2022). However, we take a different approach in selecting the spans for
          corruption: (1) we first sample a dynamic ratio of sequence to mask out,
          (2)we then sample the span length and mask out locations such that the total
          number of tokens match the ratio of the original sequence determined earlier
