        html: '<p>Hello - Thx for the great work!</p>

          <p>I want to load this model in the text generation inference v0.9.3 (latest)
          with 2x3090 24gb vRAM each. In this GitHub thread: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/issues/707#issuecomment-1653651102">https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference</a>
          they said it is not possible/will not fit?</p>

          <p>You mentioned here <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GPTQ/discussions/2#64ba51be41078fd9a059c1a6">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-chat-GPTQ/discussions/2#64ba51be41078fd9a059c1a6</a>
          that it would be possible. </p>

          <p>Please could you guide me in the right direction running this model in
          TGI with my setup?</p>
