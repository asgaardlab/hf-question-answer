        html: '<p>Hello Mr. Bloke,</p>

          <p>I assume you must be busy, but I''d like to ask if you have made any
          performance comparisons for Llama2 70B chat models vs GPTQ quant, like you
          did <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/OpenAssistant-Llama2-13B-Orca-8K-3319-GPTQ/discussions/1#64c04973a8a2dcaa166ca75f">here</a>
          . I''m just curious to know what is the performance of bigger quantized
          models vs fp16.</p>

          <p>No worries if this is not in your radar.</p>
