          saw your models in the paper above. First of all, thank you for revealing
          the wonderful models. I know that you opened 1.7b and 13b, but in the case
          of 13b, detailed specifications including config are posted along with the
          binary, but when I tried to use 1.7b, there was no accurate information.
          I would like to know when it will be posted.</p>
