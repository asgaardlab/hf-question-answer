          <p>Now return to your google drive. Go to sd/stable-diffusion-webui/modules<br>Open
          the file named sd_hijack.py (you can do this by right clicking it and then

          Save it.</p>

          <p>Now return to the colab and run all. It should work and give you a gradio
          link as intended, at least it did that for me. I don''t know if all the
          features will still work after this fix though, can''t say I''ve tested
          it. Might be unrelated but if the page hangs, refreshing it will work.</p>

          <p>To avoid having to do this each time, make a copy of the notebook, which
          will include the cell that you just created, then just use your copy next
          time.</p>

          <p>Hope it works!</p>
