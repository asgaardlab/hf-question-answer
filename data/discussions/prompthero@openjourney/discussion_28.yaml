          the file named sd_hijack.py (you can do this by right clicking it and then

          Save it.</p>

          <p>Now return to the colab and run all. It should work and give you a gradio
          link as intended, at least it did that for me. I don''t know if all the
          features will still work after this fix though, can''t say I''ve tested
          it. Might be unrelated but if the page hangs, refreshing it will work.</p>
