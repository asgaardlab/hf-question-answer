        html: '<p>Hello my fellow AI artists.<br>I am <a rel="nofollow" href="https://haghiri75.com/en">Muhammadreza
          Haghiri</a> the founder of <a rel="nofollow" href="https://opencognitives.com">Open
          Cognitives</a> and I observed something a little bit odd today. First of
          all, a person messaged me on LinkedIn and asked me about an interview about
          <em>Open Journey</em>. I immediately found out that it points to my old
          project and just out of curiosity I searched the link <code>open-journey.github.io</code>
          on Twitter and I found out a lot of people are just linking to this project
          of mine.<br>So I <strong>had to</strong> clarify it here.</p>

          <h2 id="about-the-name">About the name</h2>

          <p>Since I decided to make that project, prompthero''s model wasn''t called
          "openjourney" and this is why I chose that name. When they changed their
          name, I decided to go by the name <em>Mann-E</em>  which was my model''s
          original name. So this is the whole story. I totally forgot to remove that
          github page and it now redirects to Mann-E. </p>

          <h2 id="mann-e-and-openjourney">Mann-E and OpenJourney</h2>

          <p>Okay, this is my favorite part of the story. Since I claimed I based
          my model on PromptHero''s model I have to say it''s true. Although there
          are differences in results (specially with different schedulers) but openjourney
          (specially version 2) is somehow a good base (or merger) for Mann-E. </p>

          <h2 id="my-personal-opinion-about-prompthero">My personal opinion about
          PromptHero</h2>

          <p>What can I say? One of the most amazing teams in the field of AI Art.
