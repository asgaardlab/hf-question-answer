        html: '<p>Hi David.<br>Thanks for clarifying that you don''t need the model
          taken down (no reason why it should be anyway). I understand your point,
          especially being the founder but I doubt people are confusing this fine
          tuned model with your product. The description is correct, in different
          groups where I participate as soon as someone shares this repository, when
          other asked, all the people come out to clarify the difference.</p>

          <p>The community that we work with diffusers knows more about the tools
          and the technical operation than the people who use ready-made app  (that''s
          the magic of open source world). In the case of MJ (like many other applications)
          the About is just two paragraphs that are not very descriptive or technical.
          Perhaps the confusion comes from that side, like the media, which, as you
          well know, only talks about dall-e2 as a synonym for absolutely all text2img
          models.</p>

          <p>Hopefully one day MJ can join the open source world, we''ll welcome it
          with open arms. Despite it''s unlisted list of censored words like ''breastfeeding''
          and ''down syndrome'', and so many others that a lot of people hope they
          are reviewed. It''s a very good project, i''m a Paid Member.</p>

          <p>Coming back to the point, I really understand your position, but I hope
          that changing the name to something like mdjrny-v4-difussion will enough
          for MJ.</p>
