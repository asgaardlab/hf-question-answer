        html: '<p>I''ve seen the update today. As I''m using diffusers the model has
          been downloaded automatically. Thing is I have never installed the safetensors
          package. But I will do it now though. Thank you for taking care about our
          security.<br>The question is, what else beside installing safetensors should
          I do to enable the use of saftensors format of the model in the pipeline
          by default. Should I use it like with reviosion="safetensors" or will be
          there some kind of different setup required?</p>
