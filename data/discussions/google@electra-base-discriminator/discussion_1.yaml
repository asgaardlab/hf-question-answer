        html: '<p>On the GitHub repository says that to finetune a ELECTRA model I
          need to "get a pre-trained ELECTRA model either by training your own (see
          pre-training instructions above), or downloading the release ELECTRA weights
          and unziping them under $DATA_DIR/models". Is this the mentioned relaease
          with the weights? If not, is there any official pretrained version here
