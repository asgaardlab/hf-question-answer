          team for your invaluable contributions to the open-source community. </p>

          <p>I am particularly interested in the model training process and was curious
          to know if there are any plans to open-source the training checkpoints as
          well. The availability of such checkpoints would be a tremendous asset,
          allowing for a deeper understanding and further improvement of the models.</p>

          <p>If these have already been made available, could you please guide me
          on how to access them? Your assistance in this regard would be highly appreciated.</p>
