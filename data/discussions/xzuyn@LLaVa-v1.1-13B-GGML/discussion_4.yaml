          </p>

          <p>Using auto_GPTQ. The training prompts are not consistent, so I don''t
          really know how  to proceed. </p>

          <p>Do you know how? Or would you be willing to do it? I think LLAVA should
          work with exllama via web-generation-ui. </p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
