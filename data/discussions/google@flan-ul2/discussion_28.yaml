        html: '<p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>I have a question regarding a classification task I''m working on, and
          I would appreciate your insights. I have a very large paragraph consisting
          of approximately 4,000 to 5,000 words, and I want to generate a sequence
          of outputs for this text. Specifically, I aim to classify the paragraph
          based on its content.</p>

          <p>Given that I have access to two 32 GB GPUs, I''m wondering which pre-trained
          model would be best suited for this task. I would like to leverage the power
          of these GPUs to ensure efficient processing and accurate results.</p>

          <p>If you have any recommendations or suggestions for pre-trained models
          that excel at sequence classification tasks, I would greatly appreciate
          your input. Thank you in advance for your help!</p>
