        html: '<p>3.0 is a great model. Maybe the best open source anime xl model
          so far, thank you for all the hard works!<br>Still, I notice that the characters
          included in 3.0 is kinda limited, some classic ones were absent (like k-on!).
          I had to train some loras for my favorite characters.<br>So, just curious
          if 4.0''s gonna include more characters from more anime series?</p>
