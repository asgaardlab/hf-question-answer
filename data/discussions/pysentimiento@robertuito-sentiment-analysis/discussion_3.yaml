        html: '<p>Hi everyone: </p>

          <p>First of all, thank you for this model. </p>

          <p>I''m sorry if this is a very easy question, but I can''t figure it out
          alone. How do you get the output for the analyzer? I mean, as a list or
          a tuple. I have tried many different things, but I can''t get to handle
          correctly the output (its type is AnalyzerOutput) of the hate speech analysis
          to another function on my script. </p>

          <p>Thanks and have a good day!</p>
