        html: '<p>Amazing look in the model card samples, but unfortunately this embedding
          doesn''t work with SD v2.1 768.</p>

          <p>It produces weird hybrid images. I am wondering if you could explain;
          - where do you place the model hash number in the UI?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for your help with this inquiry. </p>
