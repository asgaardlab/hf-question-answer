        html: '<p>Hi, Would like to ask you to share your recommended settings based
          on samples, or a guide and other additions such as End of text formatting?
          I believe many who want to use the model, who are outside known official
          channels are having a subpar experience because they don''t use a recommended
          setting or a function about the end of text formatting is not yet implemented
          on their frontend. Like as of this writing, I believe popular frontend,
          AgnAI still haven''t implemented it, leading to text cutoff. So yeah, just
          a little recommendation here.</p>
