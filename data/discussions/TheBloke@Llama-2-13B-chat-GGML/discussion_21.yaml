        html: '<p>Hi! I want to deploy one of the models using Text Generation Inference
          (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference#using-a-private-or-gated-model">https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference#using-a-private-or-gated-model</a>),
          but I can''t use this repo directly cause it contains many bin files, therefore
          I thought about downloading one of them and putting into separate model
          repo. But seems like it doesn''t really work, can somebody suggest something
          on this? </p>
