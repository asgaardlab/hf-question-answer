          model can''t handle inputs of longer than 512 tokens "</p>

          <p>is there a warning that i can get in cases i exceed the  limit?<br>i
          split to sentences and in most cases its well withing the limit, but there
          are exceptions - any way to flag these exceptions before i run the "dictabert-morph"
          model ?<br>maybe running the tokenizer only (without the morphology) and
          is i reach 512 tokens i knpow i probably need to split before runing the
          morph model? </p>
