        html: '<p>I fine tuned Mask2Former for a panoptic segmentation task with 30
          base classes (with instances of each class).  The training went well and
          I am happy with the results but now I am doing some experimentation on tracking
          instances.  I am looking for embeddings that correspond to each instance
          so that I can try and do a similarity search from image to image to associate
          instances of a class as being the same in two images.  </p>

          <p>Do you know what layer of the model I would pull for this?  Or how I
          would locate these type of embeddings (called track/static queries in this
          paper: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09108.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2211.09108.pdf</a>
          for each instance)?</p>

          <p>Thank you!!</p>
