        html: '<p>Hi. I am trying to use axolotl to train a model (I saw you did in
          the like model card) and I cannot figure out how to do it. Every time I
          try I get errors. Ive tried in deepnote and in google colab. The only time
          it worked was with open-llama-3b and it only worked once. Any tips? I read
          through their readme but  i dont know how to do it. I tried their quickstart
