          size really mattered or not). Turns out it in this case it didn''t really
          matter as long as the <strong>functional batch size</strong> (w gradient
          chkpting) is ~ 128. So most of it was done on a 3080 ti! </p>

          <p>Also, a big factor in this being possible was keeping ctx length for
          pretrain to 1024 (because it could always be RoPE-scaled later if needed)</p>
