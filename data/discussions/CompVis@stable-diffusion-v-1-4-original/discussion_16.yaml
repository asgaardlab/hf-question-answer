        raw: Any prompt that includes the phrase "vector art" will very frequently
          include a repeated "iStock" watermark on the image.  This probably isn't
          the desired result, and is likely due to an unauthorized scraping of iStock
          artwork into the training set.

  content: Any prompt that includes the phrase "vector art" will very frequently include
    a repeated "iStock" watermark on the image.  This probably isn't the desired result,
    and is likely due to an unauthorized scraping of iStock artwork into the training
    set.
