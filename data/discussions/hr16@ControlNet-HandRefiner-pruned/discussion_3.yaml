          1. The workflow of HandRefiner is MediaPipe segments hands -> MeshGraphormer
          reconstructs and corrects the hands, outputs MANO mesh -> Ray-tracing with
          Trimesh to get depth map. It''s possible to replace MediaPipe with a YOLO
          model trained on bad hands. ADetailer uses one iirc

          2. Again, MediaPipe fault here

          3. I''ve seen people using GrowMaskWithBlur node by Kijai to make good masks
          from the hand depth map


          You can post this issue on the [original repo](https://github.com/wenquanlu/HandRefiner)
