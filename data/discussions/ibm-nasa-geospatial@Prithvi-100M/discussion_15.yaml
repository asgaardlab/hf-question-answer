        html: '<p>Hi, Thanks for the Prithvi-100M.</p>

          <p>I have a doubt,  how can we do a custom fine-tuning using Prithvi-100M
          would be great to know any examples for it.<br>And how can we do the data
          preprocessing for the Prithvi-specific models? Any guidelines would be helpful.</p>

          <p>Thanks in Advance </p>

          <p>We provide also some more instructions and the general framework we used  using

          <p>If you do not want to use the mmsegmentation workflow you can do finetuning
          by attaching a decoder head to Prithvi''s encoder with other framework.
          For example you can do the same in native Pytorch.</p>
