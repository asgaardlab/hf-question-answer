        html: '<p>Thanks for open-sourcing this great work. Kudos to the team!<br>On
          going through the documentation available and trying to use the model for
          certain applications there were certain things that I couldn''t figure out.
          It would be great if anyone from the team or the community helped me answer
          these.</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Size of the training dataset in terms of the number of images used for
          MAE pre-training. Is this a curated version of HLS Landsat? or were all
          the images available used?</li>

          <li>What is the time period/interval between time stamps provided to the
          model during training? What is the reasoning behind this choice and does
          the choice of the time stamp (during inference) impact the performance?</li>

          <li>Was the MAE masking percentage 75%? and for how many epochs were they
          trained?</li>

          <li>Why [B, C, T, H, W] and not [B, T*C, H, W]?</li>

          <li>In order to train the model, were all the tiles from Continental US
          used or specific regions within CONUS?</li>

          <li>Quality of MAE reconstruction in terms of SSIM? I did try using the
          model for certain patches in the US and the reconstruction quality was around
          0.8 ish with patching artefacts.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Hope to get some insights on these. Thanks in advance</p>
