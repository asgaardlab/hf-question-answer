        html: '<p>Hi, I have been working on extending Prithvi''s capabilities to
          handle images in formats other than TIFF. I''ve made modifications to the
          code to support images. This feature would be beneficial for those who want
          to use Prithvi for testing and processing non-TIFF image formats.</p>

          <p>To achieve this, I''ve created two new files: Prithvi_run_PNGinference.py
          and Prithvi_100_PNG.yaml. These files are designed to enable PNG image inference
          with Prithvi. I would like to contribute these changes to Prithvi. Is it
          acceptable if I create a pull request for these files? I''m open to feedback
          and further discussions on this.</p>
