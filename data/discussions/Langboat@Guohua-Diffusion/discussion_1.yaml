        html: '<p>That''s great, thanks.</p>

          <p>There is a drawing style in Japan which is called sumi-e, which I like
          very much. It''s black and white, very stylised, giving a sense with just
          a few strokes. Is there something similar in China? How would it be called?
          I tried to use sumi-e but the results are quite different</p>
