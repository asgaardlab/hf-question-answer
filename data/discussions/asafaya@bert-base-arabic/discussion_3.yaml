        html: '<p>Hey guys, you did a great job in making this one. However I am trying  to
          use bert to train a language model for Amharic too. So I would like to get
          heads up on how you managed to train it. Like what type of data did you
          use? Did you use vectorized tokens like as in Word2vec? Bit confused. It
          is a personal project.</p>

          <p>Thanks :P</p>
