          be clear, I recorded my own audio sample (it was in ogg format) and the
          recognition works fine. So I tried resampling my file to a 16000 sample
          rate with librosa, pytorch, ffmpeg, tried converting sample rate, bitrate,
          tried different formats - with no result. I''m starting to think that this
          is no format issue but the way recognizer works with this file...<br>But
          I also noticed that none of my files are being recognized, so I believe
          it''s the file-format problem<br>Btw same file works fine with wav2vec (different
          results when using ukrainian or russian lang, but it gives a lot of text!)<br>Could
          you suggest something please?</p>
