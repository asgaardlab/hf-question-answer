        html: '<p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>BTW, I was able to overcome most of the "GPTisms" in the next iteration
          of Aurelian, but ran into an issue while training and need to revert and
          continue from an older CP (I traded diverse prose for loss of long-context
          capability, which is the whole point of the model). Hopefully I have a fixed
          version releasing in about a week, and I think it is possible to have both.</p>
