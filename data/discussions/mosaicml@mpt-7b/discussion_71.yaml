        html: '<p>Hi all, I''m here to find some suggestion as described in the title.<br>I
          fine-tuned an MPT model and created a private repo for it. I know others
          could clone the repo with the config and parameters files to use that fine-tuned
          model. Is there any way I can store the model somewhere like a cloud service
          in AWS and make it an API call that people don''t need to download the whole
          model to use it?<br>Any discussion and suggestion are appreciated.</p>
