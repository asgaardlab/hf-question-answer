          would be against the Terms of Service here.) Furthermore, it looks like

          The license claimed is not valid for the purpose they repeatedly stated.
          I''m not seeking attention as intentionally ignoring legal and ethical issues
          is the norm (in a bad way) for both the model owners and the platform.


          @julien-c It appears you re-closed this thread intentionally. This action
          hides the concerns (which don''t show up by default in the Community Tab)
          and accepts the fact that no response was provided by the model owner.  You
          did not provide a position from HuggingFace, so I presume your conclusion
          is that everything is acceptable based on your investigation of the matter.  Please
          correct if this is not the case, you will receive a notification by being
          tagged.'
