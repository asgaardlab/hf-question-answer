        html: '<p>I finally got around to trying Marx-3B, not expecting much, and
          am totally agog at the quality of its output.</p>

          <p>I have been using Guanaco-7B, Samantha-13B, and Vicuna-33B, and there
          are a few prompts which these consistently get horribly wrong, like "What
          kind of a noise annoys a noisy oyster?" and "How much does 600 feet of worsted
          weight yarn weigh?"  Marx-3B does much better at these than even Vicuna-33B
          (albeit inconsistently).</p>

          <p>And it''s so fast!  Even inferring on the CPU, it rips out responses
          faster than I can read them.</p>

          <p>You have a winner here, and I just noticed that you released v2.  I''m
          going to go download that now and give it a spin.  Kudos!</p>
