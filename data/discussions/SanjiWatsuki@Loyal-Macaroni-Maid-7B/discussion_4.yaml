          <p>Do you think it would be possible to correct its flaws without losing
          the magic of the original? (The flaws being mainly, for me: slightly and
          periodically (re)censored, and its tendency to speak and act for the user,
          no matter the instructions I give him, even ''positive'' prompting.)<br>And
          perhaps extend its context even further? 16K, maybe?</p>
