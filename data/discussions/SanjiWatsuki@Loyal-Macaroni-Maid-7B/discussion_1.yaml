          <p>He''s right, this is literally one of the best models i''ve tested for
          roleplay. In my case i''m using The Blokes AWQ version but since this is
          a 7B model, i''m going to use the full 16 bit version from now on.</p>

          <p>The model''s memory is very on point, the output quality is also incredible.
          However from my testing, not sure if it''s my character cards or if it''s
          the AWQ or something else, but i did notice the model tries to "Curve" away
          from the NSFW stuff sometimes and it tries to avoid it. At that point i
          would have to "Convince" the character to do it. So not sure what that was
          about, but i''ll test it with the full 7B model soon. Other than that, this
          is so far the best roleplay model i''ve tested.</p>

          <p>i was prob gonna ask if there was going to be a V2 or a 13B version but
          given the fact most of the models used for this were 7B, i''m not sure if
          it''s possible, plus Mistral is also just 7B.</p>

          \ the purpose of the object instead of actually following my scenario or\
          \ in other cases it goes on to explain other similar stuff and then it says\
