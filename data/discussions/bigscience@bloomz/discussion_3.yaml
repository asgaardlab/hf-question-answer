        html: '<p>summarize: Importance:&nbsp;Phase 3 trials have not compared oral
          semaglutide, a glucagon-like peptide 1 receptor agonist, with other classes
          of glucose-lowering therapy.<br>Objective:&nbsp;To compare efficacy and
          assess long-term adverse event profiles of once-daily oral semaglutide vs
          sitagliptin, 100 mg added on to metformin with or without sulfonylurea,
          in patients with type 2 diabetes.<br>Design, setting, and participants:&nbsp;Randomized,
          double-blind, double-dummy, parallel-group, phase 3a trial conducted at
          206 sites in 14 countries over 78 weeks from February 2016 to March 2018.
          Of 2463 patients screened, 1864 adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled
          with metformin with or without sulfonylurea were randomized.<br>Interventions:&nbsp;Patients
          were randomized to receive once-daily oral semaglutide, 3 mg (n = 466),
          7 mg (n = 466), or 14 mg (n = 465), or sitagliptin, 100 mg (n = 467). Semaglutide
          was initiated at 3 mg/d and escalated every 4 weeks, first to 7 mg/d then
          to 14 mg/d, until the randomized dosage was achieved.<br>Main outcomes and
          measures:&nbsp;The primary end point was change in glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c),
          and the key secondary end point was change in body weight, both from baseline
          to week 26. Both were assessed at weeks 52 and 78 as additional secondary
          end points. End points were tested for noninferiority with respect to HbA1c
          (noninferiority margin, 0.3%) prior to testing for superiority of HbA1c
          and body weight.<br>Results:&nbsp;Among 1864 patients randomized (mean age,
          58 [SD, 10] years; mean baseline HbA1c, 8.3% [SD, 0.9%]; mean body mass
          index, 32.5 [SD, 6.4]; n=879 [47.2%] women), 1758 (94.3%) completed the
          trial and 298 prematurely discontinued treatment (16.7% for semaglutide,
          3 mg/d; 15.0% for semaglutide, 7 mg/d; 19.1% for semaglutide, 14 mg/d; and
          13.1% for sitagliptin). Semaglutide, 7 and 14 mg/d, compared with sitagliptin,
          significantly reduced HbA1c (differences, -0.3% [95% CI, -0.4% to -0.1%]
          and -0.5% [95% CI, -0.6% to -0.4%], respectively; P &lt; .001 for both)
          and body weight (differences, -1.6 kg [95% CI, -2.0 to -1.1 kg] and -2.5
          kg [95% CI, -3.0 to -2.0 kg], respectively; P &lt; .001 for both) from baseline
          to week 26. Noninferiority of semaglutide, 3 mg/d, with respect to HbA1c
          was not demonstrated. Week 78 reductions in both end points were statistically
          significantly greater with semaglutide, 14 mg/d, vs sitagliptin.<br>Conclusions
          and relevance:&nbsp;Among adults with type 2 diabetes uncontrolled with
          metformin with or without sulfonylurea, oral semaglutide, 7 mg/d and 14
          mg/d, compared with sitagliptin, resulted in significantly greater reductions
          in HbA1c over 26 weeks, but there was no significant benefit with the 3-mg/d
          dosage. Further research is needed to assess effectiveness in a clinical
          setting.</p>
