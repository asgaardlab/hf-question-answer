        html: '<p>I am working with bloomz-7b1 for a project and my mentor asked me
          to ensure that my deployment is working with the same level of performance
          that it should. Right now, the version is running decently well, but not
          good enough for my project''s purposes. I can''t tell if that''s because
          the model itself is too small or limited to get satisfactory responses or
          if it''s an issue with my project itself and the server it''s running on.</p>

          <p>It''s a pretty general question, but any pointers would be appreciated:
          how can I compare the performance of my project to the performance of bloomz-7b1
          here? I see detailed evaluations were done on the performance here but I
          am not sure how to do that myself.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
