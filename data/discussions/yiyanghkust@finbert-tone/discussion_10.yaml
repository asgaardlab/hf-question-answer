        html: '<p>I am getting two slightly different probability values when comparing
          inference results from the local transformer and inference API on the  same
          sentence. I am wondering why this is happening? It only occurs for some
          sentences. </p>

          <p>Moreover, the local transformer seems to select the highest probability
          result and return it alone compared to the API that returns a score for
          each label. Sometimes a score from the API is greater than 1 (have seen
          9) and I am wondering why that is and am if the model is still functioning
          properly.</p>

          <p>Cheers!</p>
