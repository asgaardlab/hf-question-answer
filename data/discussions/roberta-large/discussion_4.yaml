        html: '<p>Certification or authorization</p>

          <p>Good morning,<br>My discussion is regarding the following topic:<br>We
          are currently carrying out the certification of a system in the ENS (Esquema
          Nacional de Seguridad) methodology for the Spanish territory. This system
          or application makes use of the RoBERTa-Large model.</p>

          <p>We would like to know if the RoBERTa-large model has certifications of
          any type that meets functional security requirements or other similar ones,
          for example: Common Criteria.</p>

          <p>I look forward to hearing from you and any comments are welcome for clarification
          regarding this topic of discussion. </p>

          <p>Best regards and thanks in advance</p>
