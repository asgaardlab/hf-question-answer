        html: '<p>I tried to come up with an instruction template for Oobabooga Textgenereation
          WebUI but they all seem to fail.</p>

          <p>I first thought about using the Mistral instruction template, because
          it doesn''t have any extras, but that leads to gibberish.<br>I also tried
          several others, but they also didn''t work properly. Any idea? Any template
          that works, or do you maybe have a template I could use?</p>

          <p>Thank you very kindly.</p>
