        html: '<p>Hi, first of all I want to congratulate you because this embedding
          is really beautiful. I tried to use it with SD2.1 but I get errors when
          I try to generate new images. I''m really new to embeddings so I was wondering
          if they must be compatible with certain versions of Stable Diffusion. If
          they are not, then I will try to fix it by myself.</p>

          <p>Thanks!!</p>
