          \ I had very high hopes for SQLCoder-2 and since it was not working I tried\
          \ running it on A5000 GPU but still it wasn't good as I expected it.<br>As\
          \ you have found, me too.<br><strong>CodeLlama</strong> is literally understanding\
          \ the instructions and giving good results with almost all times proper\
          \ grammar <em>(valid SQL)</em>. </p>\n<p>So for now, I think codellama-7b\
          \ is promising model for me.<br>Other models I have tried:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Zephyer:\
          \ This is amazing model. It can handle amazing queries but it is not commercially\
          \ usable and is general purpose so can't beat codellama as of now.</li>\n\
          <li>Wizard-Coder: It is good for small and simple queries but not as efficient\
          \ as code llama</li>\n<li>NumbersStation's 2B model for SQL: It seem great\
          \ in the start, but it doesn't have the GGUF support. Need to test more\
          \ for my usecase, still it is 2B model at most. But they have Llama-7B version\
          \ too. You may check that out as well <em>(probably the model isn't capable\
          \ of understanding the instructions... but worth checking out)</em></li>\n\
          </ul>\n<p>I am expecting to test more models like:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mistral</li>\n\
