        html: '<p>I saw the best practice for thebloke to convert a model to GGUF
          format is to have a tokenizer.model but I don''t see it here so it may cause
          problems like the gguf model unable to predict the end token. Can you add
          it here? Or how can I get it?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advanced.</p>
