          <p>Running it locally on my CPU or even on the GPU the inference takes quite

          <p>Do you have any idea how hugging face achieves this result on CPU? Any

        html: '<p>Hi, </p>

          <p>I guess it just depends on your CPU speed. I just tested locally on my
          laptop for audio a wav file sampled at 16kHz and 4 seconds long, I have
          an average of  0.75s over 100 try.<br>If you want to speed up the inference
          locally here are some steps you can take :</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Disable gradient computation for inference using "with torch.no_grad():"</li>

          <li>Use JIT to trace your model and run inference on the traced model</li>

          </ul>
