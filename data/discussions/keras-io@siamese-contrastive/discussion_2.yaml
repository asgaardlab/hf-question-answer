        html: '<p>Hi, thank you for the interesting application. However I have some
          questions regarding the way keras-io do the labelling and the eqn of contrastive
          loss.<br>In the original pair, similar pairs are assigned as 0 and dissimilar
          pairs are assigned as 1, and the equation used are as follows:</p>

          <p>loss = [(1 - y ) x D] + [(y) X max(margin-D, 0)]</p>

          <p>However in the example given by Keras (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://keras.io/examples/vision/siamese_contrastive/">https://keras.io/examples/vision/siamese_contrastive/</a>),
          the labelling method are reversed, and the same equation of contrastive
          loss are still used. Any reason why keras did so? Thank you.</p>
