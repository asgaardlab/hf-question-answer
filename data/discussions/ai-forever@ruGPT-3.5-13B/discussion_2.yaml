    is just objective truth.'

          <p>It''s not the same thing. In Russia the state itself carries out the
          violence. Putin enforces Sharia across Russia -- at least for some. Why
          does Putin enforce Sharia? Or is it not about Sharia, rather killing people
          who make a convenient scapegoat. Fascists need somebody to blame for their
          own incompetence.</p>

          <p>Well, here''s news. Scapegoats rotate and eventually they might get to
          you or somebody you do care about. "First they came for"... And it doesn''t
          really matter if you''re useful. Yevgeny was so useful he was given an impossible
          task. And then blamed for the predicable outcome. Ever seen a narcissist
          take responsibility? No sir. Blame filters down until it gets to you.</p>

          I don''t follow your politics that closely. That''s funny. You Russians

          entertaining. Now, he was useful. Sent his own kids to the front lines to
          die and what did it get him? Nothing like a little GRU poisoning to remind
          a guy to keep fighting an un-winnable war of conquest for a fascist coward

          <p>That''s what every tyranny looks like until it consumes itself and it

          And so instead tyrannies steal. Lies justify destruction and death to take
          other people''s stuff. Just like in Ukraine. And at the top is always an
          incompetent coward surrounded by backstabbing yes men. Russia will never
          be stable like that. Just an endless, cycle of aggression, theft, consumption,
          stagnation, and collapse followed by unrealistic expectations, ignorance,
          and malice. Each time with a new scapegoat. It was religion before. Fighting
          over an economic system. Now the priests and Imams are on the persecuting
          end. Isn''t it great? It''s like the Soviet Union and Iran had a baby. LGBT
          people just can''t get a break... except in the west. Here I can get married.
          Here I worry about no death camps. Here I can poop on my keyboard all day
          long and run no fear of poisoning. I can walk past open windows without
          fear. It <em>would</em> be nice if the Russian government stop <a rel="nofollow"
