        html: '<p>Hey Undi95,<br>after both MXLewd 20B and Emerhyst 20B (16bf) gave
          me unusually bad results on a rather simple scenario, or so I thought, this
          "little" 11B model saved my day. It performed exceptionally good, with a
          very solid feeling, good story telling, and good reactive behavior. It sometimes
          puts out pure nonsense, barely relating to the story, but one reload later
          it usually is back on track with really good replies. Last time I used it,
          it repeatedly inserted some meta discussions about the RP between a "user1"
          and "user2", wich was kind of strange. But beside of those minor flaws,
          it''s a real fun model to use. Small, therefor fast, solid, creative and
          it does not have to hide behind your 20B flagships at all.<br>Greetings
          and Thanks,<br>Huegli</p>
