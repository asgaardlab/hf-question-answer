        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>This is Pedro from Hugging Face, thanks a lot for submitting a new entry
          to the Deep Reinforcement Learning Course! However, this repo contains a
          valid access token in its name, which is a security risk. I recommend you
          do the following at your earliest convenience:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Invalidate and refresh the token in <a href="https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens">this
          page</a></li>

          <li>Rename this repo :)</li>

          </ul>

          <p>While you do those changes I''ll take the liberty to set the repo''s
          visibility to private to protect your data. Feel free to change it back
          to public when you are done :)</p>

          <p>Thanks again for your contribution!</p>
