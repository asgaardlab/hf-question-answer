        html: '<p>Hi Everyone,</p>

          <p>I wanted to create a file containing this model in the format of SavedModel
          of tensorflow.<br>I have tried to load the file tf_model.h5 by using tf.keras.models.load_model(''tf_model.h5'').<br>However,
          this gave me this error: ''ValueError: No model config found in the file
          at ...''<br>Online I found that this error could mean that only the weights
          were saved and not the entire model.<br>Does someone have a solution for
          this?</p>
