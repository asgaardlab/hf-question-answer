        html: '<p>Hi Philipp,<br>I think it would be interesting to name the license
          of this model.<br>As far as I understood it uses a translation of the Alpaca
          dataset.<br>This dataset is CC-BY-NC as far as I know.<br>So is this model
          allowed for commercial use?</p>

          <p>Many thanks<br>Philip</p>
