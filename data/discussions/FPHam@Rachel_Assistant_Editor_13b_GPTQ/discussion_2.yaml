          <p>I''ve had a couple of requests to do GGML and other GPTQ variants of
          this model.</p>

          <p>I know you''re limited by upload speed, but would it be possible to upload
          a LoRA at least? Then I could merge that and upload more quants for people.</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
