        html: '<p>Hi QuanSun,<br>Sorry for the late reply. I''m currently working
          on converting the biggest models. They are simpler to deal with because
          they don''t use rope nor swiglu. This makes them closer to the CLIP architecture
          and therefore easier to adapte to an hf model. I''ll send you the code as
          soon as it''s ready. Then if you want to include the smaller models as well,
          you will just need to make a few adaptations.</p>
