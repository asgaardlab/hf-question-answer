        html: '<p>Hey there!<br>I''ve read your article about RefactorScore and it
          is amazing. I''m finishing my bachelor''s in Computer Science, following
          a similar path in my final course project. With that in mind, I evaluate
          refactorings in open-source projects, like Apache Kafka and ZooKeeper. I
          wonder how can I run RefactorBert to get the RefactorScore for specific
          repositories available on GitHub.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your time.</p>
