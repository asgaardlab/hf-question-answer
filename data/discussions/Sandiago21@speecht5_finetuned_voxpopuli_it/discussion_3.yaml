        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>I was trying to fine-tune the model for italian language considering
          the reference on the official page, however when training I get this error:<br>"RuntimeError:
          Sizes of tensors must match except in dimension 2. Expected size 16 but
          got size 256 for tensor number 1 in the list."</p>

          <p>Have you encountered the same problem? If so, how did you solve it?<br>Thank
          you!</p>

          <p>I think I have also gotten such an error at some point and usually it\
          \ had to do with the way you construct the data (input and output) that\
          \ you pass to fit the model. Obviously there is some dimension mismatch\
          \ during model fitting, but you will have to check in your code to understand\
          \ where exactly it originates from. Personally, I started my journey based\
          \ on the HuggingFace Audio course (<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction\"\
          >https://huggingface.co/learn/audio-course/chapter0/introduction</a>). You\
          \ can have a look in the respective section of that course and check also\
          \ their code template for further training text-to-speech models. It could\
          \ be of help.</p>\n"
