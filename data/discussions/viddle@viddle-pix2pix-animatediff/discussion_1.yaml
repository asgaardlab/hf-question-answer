        html: '<p>Glad you like it! Yeah, I think there are few options for a new
          version. </p>

          <p>One is just retraining the model as is. I know more about training now
          and could probably make it better. </p>

          <p>I''ve been looking at other ways to make init image models. I tried using
          my own 8 channel unet and it didn''t converge. I could try again with some
          modifications or there is a new paper by the AD authors that shows how to
          make an init model with a ControlNet like adapter. I might just wait for
          them to release the code.</p>
