        html: '<p>Hi authors! maybe a n00b question, how can I choose which code generation
          task to translate with this model?</p>

          <p>In your paper you performed several code generation tasks (code-to-code,
          text-to-code etc.), I''m interested in code-to-code, but I''m not sure if
          this model performs the code-to-code task when I call <code>model(input_ids)</code>
          or other tasks. </p>

          <p>Thanks in advance, and much appreciated for the great work and open source!</p>
