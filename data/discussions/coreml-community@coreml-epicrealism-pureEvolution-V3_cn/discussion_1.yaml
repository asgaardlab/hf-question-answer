        html: '<p>Sorry, just seeing this.  Were you using a 512x768 Original model
          with your 512x768 starting images (and 512x768 ControlNets if you were trying
          to do ControlNets)?  Everything needs to match.  For Split-einsum, only
          512x512 can be used.  Models will only convert as 512x512 for Split-einsum.  Really
          sorry I did not see your question earlier.  HF does not send out alerts
          for new items here.  I need to check manually more often.</p>
