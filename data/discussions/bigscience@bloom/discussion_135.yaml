        html: '<p>How do I use bloom model to predict a missing word in the middle
          of a sentence? I''d like as answer a list of possible words and a metric
          representing the goodness of the replacement, such as a probability.</p>

          <p>Consider this instance:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>I took my ____ for a walk.</li>

          <p>I would like an answer like this:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Dog - 0.92</li>

          <li>Cat - 0.06</li>

          <li>Horse - 0.02</li>
