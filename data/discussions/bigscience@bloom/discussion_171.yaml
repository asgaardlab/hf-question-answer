        html: "<p>Hi,</p>\n<p>I am a developer of an open source mobile text editor\
          \ called Maker+ Ci. I have built a AI chat interface on top of Maker+ Ci\
          \ called chatLink which uses files stored in M+ to set context/pre-prompts\
          \ for the bloom model which is the LLM that chatLink is using. So in chatLink\
          \ the user can easily select the file that they want to set as context,\
          \ which tells bloom how to behave when a prompt is submitted in chatLink.\
          \ I have created lots of cool prompts for bloom, including using it as a\
          \ terminal, mental health chatbot, Ai personal assistant, chatbots with\
          \ different personalities such as the intj personality and the infp personality\
          \ and the most recent one which is a qna model built from prompts and no\
          \ fine tuning. You can jump between all these different contexts in chatLink\
          \ easily. I\u2019m happy to share all these different prompts including\
          \ teaching how to use Maker+ Ci and chatLink which are both open source.\
