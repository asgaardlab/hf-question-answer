    impact assessment is far beyond CO2 emissions. Take for example the ecological
    (and societal !) disasters that the mining of the uranium used for the training
    causes.


    This is something that people often don''t know. By being misleading you reinforce
    that ignorance. We are leaving at a time when people should be aware of the impact
    of the energy they use so please be completely transparent about your environmental
    impact.'
