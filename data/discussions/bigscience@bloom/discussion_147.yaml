        html: '<p>i am trying to finetune bloom with prompts but it is limited in
          length from api endpoint. so is there any kind of way to load lot of data
          as prompt before actual input? So for example if i load function names as
          question and function bodies as answers before i ask it to write function
          about something. Or load whole code project so it would no context? i am
          not very experienced in this, so sorry for my general question.</p>
