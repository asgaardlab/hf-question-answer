        html: "<p>Hi, I have been doing exactly what you are talking about with my\
          \ open source mobile text editor called Maker+ Ci. I have built a AI chat\
          \ interface on top of Maker+ Ci called chatLink which uses files stored\
          \ in M+ to set context/pre-prompts for the bloom model which is the LLM\
          \ that chatLink is using. So in chatLink the user can easily select the\
          \ file that they want to set as context, which tells bloom how to behave\
          \ when a prompt is submitted in chatLink. I have created lots of cool prompts\
          \ for bloom, including using it as a terminal, mental health chatbot, Ai\
          \ personal assistant, chatbots with different personalities such as the\
          \ intj personality and the infp personality and the most recent one which\
          \ is a qna model built from prompts and no fine tuning. You can jump between\
          \ all these different contexts in chatLink easily. I\u2019m happy to share\
