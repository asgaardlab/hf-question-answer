        html: '<p>I am working with one of the low-resource languages which has a
          small portion of data in the roots corpus on which Bloom is trained. </p>

          <p>when I checked the token of the language, it is failed, I checked the
          all vocab of the language but the bloom tokenizer was not able to tokeneize
          that,</p>

          <p>is it possible to inject the vocabulary by using the sentence piece tokenization
          method into Bloom''s vocabulary and then tune it via a prompt?</p>

          <p>any suggestions?</p>
