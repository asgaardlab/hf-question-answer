        html: '<p>I have a paragraph I am trying to translate from English to Norwegian.
          The model performs well for the most part until it hits one particular section
          and then repeats something it had already translated prior in the paragraph.
          Why is this occurring? Example image provided below. The green text is the
          Norwegian text that is being used correctly at this time but is repeated
          incorrectly later while the yellow highlighted text is where it is being
          repeated incorrectly. The section highlighted in blue is the corresponding
          section of the yellow highlighted text from the English input.</p>

        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for your question. I think this is the hallucination
          happening at the inference time, and nothing to do with the implementation.
          For improvement, I would suggest fine-tuning on a specific language direction
          of your interest. Please let know me of your further concerns.</p>
