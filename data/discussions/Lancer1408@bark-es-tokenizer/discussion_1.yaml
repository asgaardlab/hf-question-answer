          should already be able to create the files needed to create the tokenizer
          straight from the GUI</p>

          <p>So yeah, you need a bunch of books in korean, not sure how the symbol
          encoding would work sadly sorry on that.<br>If the GUI can indeed now create
          and train it should do everything on it''s own, so the process goes like
          this: the semantic data is created automatically from the books you input,
          as the program will pick random lines save them on their own files and create
          Wav files on its own AND then from both the new saved lines and the created
          waves it will generate semantic data.</p>
