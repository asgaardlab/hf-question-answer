          <p>I took your words to heart and tested a Hermes/Airoboros/ToxicDPO/NoRobots
          blend and it turned out quite soulful. You can find it here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/jeiku/ToxicNoRobotsRosaHermesBoros_3B_GGUF">https://huggingface.co/jeiku/ToxicNoRobotsRosaHermesBoros_3B_GGUF</a></p>

          <p>It took me a while to get the LoRAs trained with my limited tools, but
          I hope you like it!</p>
