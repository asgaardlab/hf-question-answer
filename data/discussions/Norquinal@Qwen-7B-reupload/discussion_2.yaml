          <p>There''s not a shard missing, this is the Qwen-7B exactly as it was uploaded
          roughly around August 28th or so. If you compare the file sizes in this
          repository to the one in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20230828190052/https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen-7B">archive</a>,
          you''ll see that they match up perfectly. As for why the finetunes are bigger,
          I''m honestly not sure. Could be maybe due to how the file sizes of each
          side are being counted? Or perhaps it''s from a mistake/thing I did while
          finetuning.</p>
