        html: '<p>Hello!<br>Your bunyip model is insanely good. Not only for snakes
          but for two-legged girls and even some cybernetics. There''s nothing about
          merging in the readme file, so I have to ask. Would you give me an approval
          to use it in my merge for distribution over civitai.com? Of course, I''m
          always giving all the credit and links, and I''m restricting any commercial
          use (it was required by some of my source models). I already did some private
          experiments and I like the result very much. At just 50% it still can generate
          lamias and my other prompts are improved considerably. Sometimes the lamias
          are cursed and legs get scales, but not too often. A couple of pictures
          for illustration below. Of course, if you''re against any merging, this
          build will never be published, that goes without saying.<br><a rel="nofollow"
