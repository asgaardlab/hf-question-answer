          <p>Thank you for providing the pre-trained models. We are currently participating
          in a challenge, where only certain subsets from LibriSpeech may be used.
          We would therefore would like to know, which subset from LibriSpeech was
          used to pre-train this model. Was it train-clean-100? Also, is it stated
          in any place, so we can notify the creators of the challenge if necessary?</p>

          <p>Kind regards,<br>Carlos</p>
