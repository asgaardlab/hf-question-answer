        html: '<p>Hi, First of all thanks for doing this great job.</p>

          <p>I have a use case where user can ask question from the given pdf file.
          I tested dolly its answer is decent but i need precise answer for that.
          So for that we need to finetune dolly. I have gone through the github repo
          i found codes for that but that codes are written of DB notebooks. I am
          new to this fine tuning thing. Please suggest how to finetune dolly on our
          dataset using our on prem GPU.  I am having V100-SXM2-32GB gpu. I want to
          fine tune the 3b parameter model</p>

          <p>Thanks for your help</p>
