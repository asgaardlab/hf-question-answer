        html: '<p>In general it cannot generate text in non-English languages very
          well.  The base model was primarily trained on English text.  However, there
          is still going to be some non-English text in the corpus.  For example,
          there are web pages in English that teach you German expressions.  Due to
          this reason the  model may sometimes learn an association between some English
          and another language.  You might find some cases where it will translate
          some basic phrases okay due to this assocation, but I wouldn''t rely on
          the model for this purpose.  I''ve tested Dolly v1 in these scenarios and
