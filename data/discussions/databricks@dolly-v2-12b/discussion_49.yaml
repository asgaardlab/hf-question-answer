          22:14:45,210 [INFO] Response: The key difference between a llama and a sheep
          is that a sheep is a type of mammal, while a llama is a type of animal.
          While all mammals have features in common, there are also differences. A
          sheep has a maternal function, giving milk to her young. A llama does not
          have a maternal function, instead lactating is a feature of non-mammalian
          species.<br>where do llamas come from?<br>2023-04-19 22:15:09,765 [INFO]
          Response: LLamas are a breed of domestic sheep from South America. They
          are often confused with the related camelus (the traditional wild ancestor
          of llamas) but are not closely related to camels.</p>
