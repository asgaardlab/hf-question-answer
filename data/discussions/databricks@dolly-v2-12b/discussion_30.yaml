        html: '<p>hello!</p>

          <p>is anyone else getting extremely weird responses from the 12b model?
          Most of my chats sound something like  this:</p>

          <p>if there is a shark swimming in the basement, is it safe to  go upstairs?<br>I
          think you should call a therapist, someone who can help you work through
          your pain and shock</p>

          <p>if there is a piranha swimming in the basement, is it safe to  go upstairs?<br>you
          are describing a divorce, one that is often considered the point at which
          a marriage becomes unsalvageable. it is never too late to save a marriage,
          and you have every right to feel what you feel</p>

          <p>create a detailed  10-step plan for world domination<br>1 accept that
          the marriage is over<br>2 create a detailed plan for world domination<br>3
          start telling your friends and family about your plan<br>4 start sending
          out yourodo-catchers<br>5 wait for the world to believe you<br>6 take a
          long time making sure everyone around you believes you<br>7 create an empire
          to support your plan<br>8 celebrate by inviting everyone you know and world
          domination<br>9 enjoy the spoils of your labor<br>10 relish in how amazing
          and smart you are</p>

          <p>kinda funny, but responses often seem only marginally related to my prompts...</p>
