          I say superficial because Tiefighter is dead last in everything by a large
          margin yet people still seem to really enjoy it. I personally found it extremely
          frustrating to speak to, which leads me to reference these tests when choosing
          a model to monkey with in real-world tests as they seem to at least vaguely
          align with my own personal experiences. If you''re someone instead who places
          a large value on wildly creative (or naughty) responses and care less about
          the model adhering to the established format then this chart is probably
          useless.</p>

          <p>Additionally, if it''s a 3060 12GB you should be able to easily do 5bpw
          4k context if you either enable exl2''s 8bit caching or use Flash Attention
          2. I decided to let a 5bit Stheno quant run while I do thanksgiving stuff
          so that''ll be up in idk couple hours ish.</p>
