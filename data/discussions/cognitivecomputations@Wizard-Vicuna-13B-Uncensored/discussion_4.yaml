        html: '<p>I love your work. These uncensored models are much needed.</p>

          <p>I''m getting tired of asking this about every model... but what prompt
          format was it trained on?</p>

          <p>For goodness sake people, when you release an instruction-tuned model,
          you need to tell us what prompt format was used to feed instructions to
          the model during training. It''s ridiculous that we have to guess or hunt
          through dozens of pages of source code searching for clues.</p>

          <p>I assume this one was trained with the Vicuna 1.1 prompt format. But
          it would be nice if people would say so on the model card.</p>
