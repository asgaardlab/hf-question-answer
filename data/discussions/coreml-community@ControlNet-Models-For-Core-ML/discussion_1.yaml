        html: '<p>I''m in the same place as you.  I tried passing it a mask (white,
          black, green, transparent) along with an image using the i2i argument, tried
          that reversed, and tried with a masked image (white, black, green, transparent
          masked area), and it never seemed to understand the mask.  I think it needs
          a second input and some dedicated code added in Apple''s package.  I posted
          for help/info over there (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion/issues/181">https://github.com/apple/ml-stable-diffusion/issues/181</a>)
          a few weeks ago with no response yet.  Maybe you can do a "me too" there
          to bump that post to the top of a "recent" list, but I''m assuming the silence
          means t is just not supported.  FWIW, the Python pipeline, if I am remembering
          right, uses a second input for the mask that it reads in as L,r,b,g.  So
          it probably converts it to just the L channel and adds that into the r,g,b
          of the input image, and then goes from there.</p>
