          <p>I think the issue is the subfolders.  Try with the individual 723.1 mlmodelc
          files placed directly in the "controlnet" folder, eliminating the "OpenPose"
          folder.  I realize now this is confusing because a folder is ok (and necessary)
          when you unzip a main model file.  The only reason there is an OpenPose
          folder was because of the zipping of the 4 individual files.  Each file
          is an actual model, so each file needs to go directly in the "controlnet"
          model store folder.  Post back if that is the fix for you and I''ll add
          this info to the README.  And thank you for asking here.</p>

          <p>So the issue is that your system does not know that a <code>.mlmodelc</code>

          Xcode installed in order for the system to know that an <code>.mlmodelc</code>
          folder is to be treated as a package.  All of the developers who work on
          Mochi have Xcode installed, so it is possible we would not ever see them
          as folders, and if that is a problem with making them work, we would not
          know there is a problem.</p>

          <p>Is it really a problem, or are you just getting a different Finder display
          from me?  </p>

          <p>Does your Mochi not "see" and list the different ControlNet modules that
          you put in your <code>controlnet</code> folder when you try to use a ControlNet?
