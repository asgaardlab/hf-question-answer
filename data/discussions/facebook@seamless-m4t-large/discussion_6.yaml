        html: '<p>In the model card, to save it to a wav file, the synthesize_speech
          function expects a parameter called "speech_units" . I tried to look for
          an example or explanation of what it is, but unfortunately, I can''t. </p>

          <p>Can someone please clarify what this is, and post an example on how to
          create the speech_units object?</p>

          <p>Thank you</p>

          <p>Update:<br>One can save the wav file without utilizing the synthesize_speech
          function above, but still, the model card has mentioned it but never explicitly
          explained it. Looking forward to know what the function does and explore
          how I''d be able to utilize it.</p>
