        html: '<p>Hi, I have a very similar problem. The model does not work well
          with an input as the following: </p>

          <p>INPUT:<br>: Text:<br>Thank you for calling Nissan. My name is Lauren.
          Can I have your name? Yeah. My name is John Smith. Thank you, John. How
          can I help you? I was just calling about to see how much it would cost to
          update the map in my car. I''d be happy to help you with that today. Did
          you receive a mailer from us? I did. Do you need the customer number? Yes,
          please. Okay. 5243. Thank you. And the year, make and model of your vehicle?
          Yeah, I have a 2009 Nissan Altima. Oh, nice car. Yeah, thank you. We really
          enjoy it. Okay, I think I found your profile here. Can I have you verify
          your address and phone number, please? Yes, it''s 1255 North Research Way.
          That''s in Oram, Utah. 84097. And my phone number is 801431 1000. Thanks.
          John, I located your information. The newest version we have available for
          your vehicle is version 7.7, which was released in March of 2012. The price
          of the new map is $99, plus shipping and tax. Let me go ahead and set up
          this order for you. Well, can we wait just a second? I''m not really sure
          if I can afford it right now. All right, well, here are a few reasons to
          consider purchasing today. It looks as though you haven''t updated your
          vehicle for three years. So that would be the equivalent of getting three
          years worth of updates for the price of one. Okay. In addition, special
          offers like the current promotion don''t come around too often. I would
          definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires.
          Yeah, that does sound pretty good. Good. If I set this order up for you
          now, it''ll ship out today, and for $50 less, do you have your credit card
          handy and I can place this order for you now? Yeah, let''s go ahead and
          use a Visa. </p>

          <p>Summarize the above text into a paragraph. </p>

          <p>OUTPUT:<br>: Text:<br>Thank you for calling Nissan. My name is Lauren.

    \ cost to update the map in my car. I'd be happy to help you with that today.\
    \ Did you receive a mailer from us? I did. Do you need the customer number? Yes,\
    \ please. Okay. 5243. Thank you. And the year, make and model of your vehicle?\
    \ Yeah, I have a 2009 Nissan Altima. Oh, nice car. Yeah, thank you. We really\
    \ enjoy it. Okay, I think I found your profile here. Can I have you verify your\
    \ address and phone number, please? Yes, it's 1255 North Research Way. That's\
    \ in Oram, Utah. 84097. And my phone number is 801431 1000. Thanks. John, I located\
    \ your information. The newest version we have available for your vehicle is version\
    \ 7.7, which was released in March of 2012. The price of the new map is $99, plus\
    \ shipping and tax. Let me go ahead and set up this order for you. Well, can we\
    \ wait just a second? I'm not really sure if I can afford it right now. All right,\
    \ well, here are a few reasons to consider purchasing today. It looks as though\
    \ you haven't updated your vehicle for three years. So that would be the equivalent\
    \ of getting three years worth of updates for the price of one. Okay. In addition,\
    \ special offers like the current promotion don't come around too often. I would\
    \ definitely recommend taking advantage of the extra $50 off before it expires.\
    \ Yeah, that does sound pretty good. Good. If I set this order up for you now,\
    \ it'll ship out today, and for $50 less, do you have your credit card handy and\
    \ I can place this order for you now? Yeah, let's go ahead and use a Visa. \n\n\
    Summarize the above text into a paragraph. \n\nOUTPUT: \n<human>: Text: \nThank\
    \ you for calling Nissan. My name is Lauren. Can I have your name? Yeah. My name\
    \ is John Smith. Thank you, John. How can I help you? I was just calling about\

    \ you with that today. Did you receive a mailer from us? I did. Do you need the\

    \ Sure, a short story and dialog based on the theme \"being a good friend\" could\
