          <p>First of all, thank you guys very much for this release. This means much
          for the german llm community. Secondly, in the reddit post I read that 70b
          is comming. I would love to see this soon as there are no other german oriented
          70b models.</p>

          <p>Ps: Are these models trained with refusals / censorship?</p>

          <p>Kind regards,<br>Timon</p>
