        html: '<p>Hello, I noticed that you recently committed a new 3T checkpoint
          model that seems to have reverted the "final model" <code><a href="/TinyLlama/tinyLlama-intermediate-checkpoints-after-1T-token/commit/fad4f1a">fad4f1a</a></code>
          commit from several days ago.</p>

          <p>I was wondering if there were any significant differences between the
          two models, because I happened to have used the older <code><a href="/TinyLlama/tinyLlama-intermediate-checkpoints-after-1T-token/commit/fad4f1a">fad4f1a</a></code>
          commit as a base for finetuning. Thanks!</p>
