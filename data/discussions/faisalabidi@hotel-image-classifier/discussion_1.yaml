        html: '<p>Hi Nico.</p>

          <p>My goal was to integrate with Google image search to dynamically download
          images for fine tuning. The approach was inspired by another Hugging Face
          example project, I tried to make improvements to the image search api code
          because I found that google image api results were very bad compared to
          when we use the browser to do a search. Some manual curation of the auto
          downloaded images is needed.</p>

          <p>Your can also do a Google search in the browser, use an image Downloader
          plugin to download all the images and place them in the appropriate folder.</p>

          <p>Not sure what is the scope and learning objectives of your uni project,
          but consider that this project might make it too easy for you and not give
          you a good challenge if you need to practice ML foundations.</p>

          <p>Hope you can find it useful in any case, good luck!</p>
