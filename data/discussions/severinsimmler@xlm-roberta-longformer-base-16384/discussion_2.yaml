          <p>It is very valuable to have a pytorch version of this model and thank
          you very much for that! While I am trying to use the large version of the
          original model (<a href="https://huggingface.co/hyperonym/xlm-roberta-longformer-large-16384">https://huggingface.co/hyperonym/xlm-roberta-longformer-large-16384</a>).
          Do you have any interest to create it? Or would you mind sharing the method
          for converting the original TF model into this pytorch version, so that
          I could try by myself?</p>

          <p>Thank you!</p>
