          <p>Hi there! Sorry for the delayed response, I hadn''t seen this yet.<br>I''ve
          not tried to include other languages yet mostly because there aren''t that
          many datasets available for this type of task. If you wanted to support
          German (or any other language) the best idea would be to make a dataset
          similar to the one used to train this model, and then fine-tune it on that.
          </p>

          <p>Maybe it''d even be possible to simply translate the dataset used for
          this model (in whole or in part) so that the model can train on what is/isn''t
          acceptible.</p>

          <p>For a base model, I would recommend using "mdeberta-v3", as it is already
          trained on multiple languages so it''ll have a head start on this task.
          I believe the regular deberta-v3 (that this moderation model is trained
          on) is primarily English-only. </p>

          <p>I hope this information helps, and if you''d be interested in making
          a German dataset, feel free to let me know as I''d love to expand this project!
          :)</p>
