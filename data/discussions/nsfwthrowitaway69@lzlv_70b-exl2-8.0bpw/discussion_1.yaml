        html: '<p>I finally made a HF account after using this site for a whole year
          now just to thank you. This is the first 8BPW exl2 quant of a 70B model
          that''s been uploaded to huggingface. It seems to be at least as good if
          not better then Goliath-120B exl2 4.5BPW in my limited testing.</p>

          <p>If you find any other good 70B models it would be greatly appreciated
          if you could exl2 quantize them to 8BPW and upload them here as well!</p>
