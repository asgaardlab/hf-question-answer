          <p>It''s multi-shot.  I''m new to this stuff, so I doubt I have a firm grasp
          on how to best utilize this for e.g. AlPacino''s use cases (various species
          of narrative/story writing), but I figured I''d forward it to you in case
          you hadn''t seen it.  Doesn''t KoboldAI have hooks for memory or summarization
          or something?<br>Seems like it would be fairly easy to leverage this to
          improve the cogency of a narrative.</p>
