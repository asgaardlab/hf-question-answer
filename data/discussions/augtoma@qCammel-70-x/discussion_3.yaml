        html: '<p>I skimmed through the paper and saw you used the Vicuna code base.  So
          I''m going to guess the template is something like:</p>

          <pre><code>User: {prompt}

          Assistant:

          </code></pre>

          <p>In the paper you showed an example of :</p>

          <pre><code>Human: question

          Clinical Camel: answer

          </code></pre>

          <p>But it''s unclear if this is the actual prompt template, or just how
          it was presented in the paper?</p>

          <p>I am going to quantise this model to GGML and GPTQ, to make it more accessible
          for people to try.  For now I will mark the prompt template as Vicuna, but
          if this is incorrect I can update it later.</p>

          <p>Thanks again.</p>
