          <p>I would like to preface this with the statement that we don''t run this
          repo as a public service nor do we advertise it as such. This is first and
          foremost a private backup for friends as we respect the decision of model
          makers to pull their models from public distribution. As such access is
          completely at our discretion. That being said, the only reason I generally
          reject people, outside of a handful of exceptions, is if you are using an
          email provider that has been flagged as suspicious. If you were rejected
          it''s very likely that you are using some sort of email service that is
          frequently abused by spam bots or other malicious actors.</p>

          <p>In any case, you can always obtain access through applying to the parent
          org or requesting that the rejection be reversed. I will note that in any
          case accusing us of running a phishing scam is not really going to make
          a favorable impression.</p>
