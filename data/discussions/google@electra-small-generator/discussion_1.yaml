          <p>I have been trying to reproduce the results for some time and the loss
          collapsed in each experiment. I was not careful with the size of the generator
          as I trusted this version to be scaled properly for the corresponding google/electra-small-discriminator
          model.</p>

          <p>It turns out this model is actually scaled as the Electra-small ++ model,
          which explains my collapse issue.<br>I think it would benefit everyone and
          be less misleading if there was a warning of some sort explaining this in
          the model card. Could you please consider adding such a disclaimer?</p>

          <p>Thank you again for sharing the weights here,<br>Nathan</p>
