    1.An encoder-decoder framework, drawing an analogy to machine translation tasks,
    where one cell''s embedding serves as input to the encoder/Geneformer, and the
    objective is to transform or "translate" it into another cell''s embedding through
    the decoder.

    2.Using a pair of encoders/Geneformers with cross attention to process the two
    cell embeddings and then merge the results, aiming to better capture the mutual
    information between the cells.

    In your opinion, which of these approaches might be more suitable for capturing
    cell-cell communication? Or is there another architecture you''d recommend considering?


    Thank you for your guidance!'
