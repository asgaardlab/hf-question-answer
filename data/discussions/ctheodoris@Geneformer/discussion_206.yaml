        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! It would be helpful for
          you to elaborate on what error you are encountering to determine whether
          it is truly a version issue or not and to help you troubleshoot. The functions
          we use from loompy in the transcriptome tokenizer are pretty basic and not
          likely to be subject to version issues. For reference, the current version
          of loompy I am using is 3.0.6, but I don''t expect there to be an issue
          with using 3.0.7. Regarding scanpy and anndata, the transcriptome tokenizer
          does not use those packages currently. The example for transcriptome tokenization
          has information on the required fields in the .loom file. </p>
