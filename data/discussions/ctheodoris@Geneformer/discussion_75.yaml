        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. As stated in the manuscript,
          we excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and
          immortalized cell lines) that may lead to substantial network rewiring without
          companion genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. While this led
          to less cells being included overall, we wanted to prioritize training a
          high quality embedding space with the knowledge that the model could always
          be fine-tuned towards cancer applications after the pretraining established
          its fundamental understanding of network dynamics. The approach you outlined
          is exactly how we would suggest proceeding. You can follow the disease classifier
          example to tune the learning hyperparameters for your application. We would
          suggest you use multiple labeled breast scRNAseq datasets if available for
          fine-tuning to ensure the model observes a broad range of examples so that
          it does not overfit to a particular dataset and is generalizable to your
          new dataset. </p>

          <p>As with any machine learning, we suggest you separate your data into
          train, validation, and test sets, where the train and validation sets are
          different individuals as opposed to cells subsampled from the same individual,
          and the test set is a totally separate held-out dataset (if available) to
          confirm your model performance after fine-tuning.</p>
