        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for this awesome work. We are currently trying to apply Geneformer
          to our study, in the paper you mentioned that high mutational genes are
          excluded in pretrained model, could I learn what is your high mutational
          burden screening criteria? Thank you very much. </p>
