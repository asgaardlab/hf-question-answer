        html: '<p>Hello. Suppose I have 2 new datasets of in vitro embryoid bodies,
          one with annotation (dataset A) and the other without (B). Dataset A is
          also quite different from dataset B (say, from different species with gene
          names inferred by orthologous mapping). Is it possible to incorporate their
          information into your pretrained models by self-supervised training (no
          cell-type annotation)? After that, I can use dataset A to fine-tune for
          cell classification and finally infer the cell types in dataset B. </p>

          <p>Will this way improve the classification of dataset B? Thank you. </p>
