        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. The model provided in
          this repository is the pretrained Geneformer model. In the manuscript we
          fine-tuned this pretrained model towards a diverse panel of downstream tasks.
          The pretrained model is able to be fine-tuned towards your downstream task
          of interest or used directly with zero-shot learning.</p>

          <p>Regarding your question about network centrality in the network downstream
          of NOTCH1: in the manuscript, we fine-tuned the model to predict central
          vs. peripheral genes in the NOTCH1 network in endothelial cells. Because
          gene networks are highly context-specific, we would expect that the gene
          network downstream of NOTCH1 in brain would be different. Therefore, we
          would recommend fine-tuning the pretrained model for brain if your question
          is which genes are central vs. peripheral in the NOTCH1 network in brain.
          The pretrained model can also be used for zero-shot learning to determine
          genes expected to be affected by an in silico pertrubation, as shown in
          the manuscript for GATA4 and TBX5. However, the choice of whether to use
          the pretrained model directly or fine-tune the model really depends on your
          specific question and how close the task is to the pretraining objective.</p>
