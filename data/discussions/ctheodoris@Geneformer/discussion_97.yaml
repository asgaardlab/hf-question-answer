        html: '<p>Hello and thank you for making GeneFormer available. I have few
          questions that I would like to discuss. First question is regarding the
          tokenizer - can you give a bit more detailed explanation how it works. My
          understanding is that it takes cell sequence and assigns ids based on which
          genes have been expressed in this sequence. Is that correct? Does the score
          of how much is gene expressed play a role and how? </p>

          <p>I have seen examples where you have classified genes within a cell (using
          token classification), or where you have classified cell whether is with
          or without disease. However, if I have a set of genes with some feature,
          and set of genes that do not express same feature, can I use geneformer''s
          method to predict on the bigger set of genes which will have a given feature?
          Or it is not possible and I can only work within boundaries of gene/token
          classification within gene or cell classification? </p>

          <p>Also, one question I have, since in cell sequences, the ordering of genes
          that are expressed does not really matter, at least not as in text, what
          is the intuition based on which token classification of genes would work?

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! Regarding how the transcriptome
          tokenizer works, please see the section "Rank value encoding of single-cell
          transcriptomes" in our manuscript Methods. This is also relevant to your
          question about how genes are not expressed in a positional sequence. As
          discussed in the manuscript, our method encodes the transcriptome of each
          single cell as a non-parametric rank value encoding where genes are ranked
          by their expression in that cell normalized by their expression across the
          entire Genecorpus-30M, prioritizing genes that distinguish cell state. This
          rank-based approach may be more robust against technical artifacts that
          may systematically bias the absolute transcript counts value whereas the
          overall relative ranking of genes within each cell remains more stable.
          This also opens the opportunity to use transformer-based architectures for
          any data type that can be represented as ranks that encode relevant features
          as opposed to purely sequential data.</p>

          <p>Regarding your question about classifying genes that have a particular
          feature, if I understand your question, you are trying to classify genes
          that have feature X vs. genes that do not have feature X. This application
          can be accomplished by fine-tuning the model for gene classification by
          providing the model with example genes and their accompanying labels of
          having or lacking feature X. The model could then predict whether unseen
          genes have feature X or not. </p>

          <p>We provide example code here for gene classification, cell classification,
          and in silico perturbation/treatment analysis. However, Geneformer can be
          fine-tuned for additional downstream tasks with the relevant fine-tuning
          task objective and is not at all bounded by these examples. We have integrated
          with Huggingface to allow users to take full advantage of their extensive
          and user-friendly tools. For example, Geneformer can be readily used for
          any of the BERT fine-tuning objectives that Huggingface provides (<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert">https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/bert</a>)
          by swapping out the model type in the example classification notebooks when
          loading the model. Additional applications beyond those provided by Huggingface
          can be designed by adding a head layer specific to the task or using gene
          or cell embeddings outputted by Geneformer as the input to a model on top
          of Geneformer. </p>
