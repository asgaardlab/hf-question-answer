        html: '<p>Thank you for your question and interest in Geneformer! The primary
          purpose of this repository is to enable the community to use the pretrained
          Geneformer model to answer their own scientific questions. Large-scale pretraining
          of a foundation model like Geneformer requires expertise and computational
          resources that are not universally available so by providing the pretrained
          model we can democratize the fundamental knowledge gained by Geneformer
          during pretraining to the broader scientific community.</p>

          <p>We additionally provide the code for pretraining along with Genecorpus-30M
          in the dataset repository to help researchers who would like to pretrain
          their own models instead of using Geneformer. One of the contributions of
          this work is developing a new method for encoding gene expression data as
          rank value encodings so we provide the tools for researchers to do that
          as well. All of the raw counts data that we tokenized in Genecorpus-30M
          is publicly available and not data that we generated. The datasets are available
          from the original authors and databases as cited in the manuscript Methods.
          Additionally, Genecorpus-30M was established over 2 years ago, so there
          is much more data available since then and now there are even more databases
          for collecting large amounts of data in a straightforward way. We would
          encourage users to check out CellxGene (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/">https://cellxgene.cziscience.com/</a>),
          for example, which is a new endeavor that contains large amounts of single
          cell RNAseq data along with structured metadata. </p>
