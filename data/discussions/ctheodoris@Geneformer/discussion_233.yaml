        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! With pretraining a new
          model, a good approach would be to first confirm that the pattern of the
          validation loss curve for the pretraining objective is as expected with
          a consistent decline of loss and then directly test performance on a diverse
          panel of downstream tasks to confirm the model''s efficacy. There is no
          specific pretraining loss value that I would suggest as a cutoff for determining
          whether the model will perform well and generalizably on downstream tasks.</p>
