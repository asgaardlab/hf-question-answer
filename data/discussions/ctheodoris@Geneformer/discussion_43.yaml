        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I have a question about the InSilicoPerturberStats function. Currently,
          users have to choose "goal_state_shift" or "vs_null" options for "model".  For
          example:<br>ispstats = InSilicoPerturberStats(mode="goal_state_shift",<br>                                combos=0,<br>                                anchor_gene=None,<br>                                cell_states_to_model={"disease":(["dcm"],["nf"],["hcm"])})</p>

          <p>What if my dataset contains only one state, and I want to check the perturbation
          on which gene would influence most on the overall embedding? In that case,
          should I select the "vs_random" option, which is still in development?</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Martin</p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. We added the ispstats
          mode "mixture_model", which fits a mixture model with 2 components to the
          test perturbations for a given set of cells provided by the user. The output
          then reports whether each test perturbation is in the impact component (expected
          to have an impact on the cell state), both for the average cosine shift
          caused by the test perturbation and as a percentage by averaging each detection
          of the test perturbation (i.e. for a gene tested in 100 cells, the percentage
          will be the percentage of cells where that gene''s perturbation caused a
          cosine shift with a value predicted to be in the impact component - so if
          95 of the tested cells showed a cosine shift in response to that gene''s
          perturbation that was in the impact component, the percentage reported will
          be 95%). Please note that the mixture model is fit with the average of each
          perturbation''s effect across cells, so this strategy would work best when
          the given perturbation is tested in uniform cell populations. Users may
          also use the function "read_dictionaries" in ispstats to extract the data
          to implement their own statistical analyses.</p>
