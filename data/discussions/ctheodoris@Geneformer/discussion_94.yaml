        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! As discussed in prior
          closed discussions, the gene classification example notebook is a generalizable
          example for performing any of the gene classification applications demonstrated

          task-specific labels, and the # of frozen layers as indicated in Supplementary
          Table 2 of the manuscript. Please refer to the manuscript Methods, Supplementary
          Table 2, Fig. 3, and Extended Data Fig. 7-8 to see the various models we
          fine-tuned for bivalent chromatin marks and the classes used for each. The

          all three labels.</p>
