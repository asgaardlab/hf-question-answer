        html: '<p>Thank you for this great tool! I am trying to investigate the effect
          of gene perturbation on cell types classification. I am using <code>Geneformer/fine_tuned_models/geneformer-6L-30M_CellClassifier_cardiomyopathies_220224</code>
          as the <code>CellClassifier</code> and  <code>Genecorpus-30M/example_input_files/cell_classification/disease_classification/human_dcm_hcm_nf.dataset</code>
          as the datasets. I filter for Cardiomyocytes only and retrieve cell types
          classification results produced by <code>geneformer-6L-30M_CellClassifier_cardiomyopathies_220224</code>model
          after deleting/overexpress some genes. At the moment, I deleted ''GATA4''
          just as a test gene to be perturbed. In the results I got, some cells switched
          from ''Cardiomyocyte1'' to ''Cardiomyocyte2''. I wonder if there are definitions/meanings
          to the class names ''Cardiomyocyte1'', ''Cardiomyocyte2'' or ''Cardiomyocyte3''?
          I would guess they are subtypes of cardiomyocyte.<br>Thank you for your
          time and thanks again for your work went into building such amazing tool!</p>
