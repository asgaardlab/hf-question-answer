          \ the ~30M cells in Genecorpus-30M to prioritize genes that uniquely distinguish\
          \ cell state. Please refer to the manuscript Methods for additional discussion.\
          \ The nonzero mask serves to encode only genes that are detected in the\
          \ specific given cell, thereby creating an efficient dense representation.\
          \ The model learns from the absence of particular genes to understand the\
          \ cell\u2019s state as well, similarly to how the absence of certain words\
          \ in a sentence are informative (e.g. the absence of negative words in a\
          \ movie review would lead to an NLP model interpreting the review as having\
          \ a more positive sentiment). When adding genes to the encoding, for example\
