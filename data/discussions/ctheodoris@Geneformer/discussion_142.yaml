          <p>I would like to ask, has the human_dcm_hcm_nf.dataset provided in Genecorpus-30M\

          \ 'sex': 'Female',\n 'disease': 'nf',\n 'lvef': nan}\n\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>In the dataset, I found 16 individuals with nf, two of whom have lvef\
          \ as nan. However, the text indicates that the number of non-failing is\
