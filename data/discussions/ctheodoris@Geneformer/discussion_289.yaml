        html: '<p>Dear Christina V. Theodoris:</p>

          <p>My name is Guangda Rong. I am a Ph.D. student from Nanfang Hospital,
          currently working on the deep learning models of oncology.</p>

          <p>I recently had the opportunity to read your paper "Transfer learning
          enables predictions in network biology" published in Nature, and I was impressed
          by the depth of your research and the insights presented. Your work was
          particularly relevant to my current research endeavours.</p>

          <p>As I delved into the details of your paper, I came across a few points
          where I had some questions and was hoping to seek clarification. I believe
          that your expertise would be of great help to me in gaining a better understanding.
          Here are the specific questions I have:</p>

          <p>With transcriptomic data (bulk RNAseq) and clinical data, I would like
          to implement the function of gene dosage sensitivity prediction, but I don''t
          know how to convert the transcriptomic data and clinical data into the input
          file of the code named "gene_classification.ipynb" which was shared in the
          Huggingface(<a href="https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/tree/main/examples">https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/tree/main/examples</a>).
          Could you please tell me how to solve this problem? The file format of the
          transcriptomic and clinical data was shown in the attachment.</p>

          <p>I understand that you have a busy schedule, but any insight or guidance
          you could provide would be invaluable to me. I appreciate your time and
          consideration.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your contributions to the field and I look forward to hearing
          from you.</p>

          <p>Yours sincerely,</p>

          <p>The input of Geneformer is single-cell RNAseq data. Please see here for
          more information on the input format and how to convert it to a tokenized
          dataset for use with the model:<br><a href="https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/blob/main/examples/tokenizing_scRNAseq_data.ipynb">https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/blob/main/examples/tokenizing_scRNAseq_data.ipynb</a></p>

          <p>We have not tested using bulk RNAseq data but this question has arisen
          previously - please check the closed discussions to read about some potential
          approaches to using bulk RNAseq as an input format.</p>

          <p>The gene_classification notebook is an example for fine-tuning the model
          towards gene classification. You can proceed with the notebook as is to
          obtain a fine-tuned model for this purpose, and then you can apply that
          fine-tuned model to make predictions about gene dosage sensitivity of particular
          genes in a given single cell presented to the model.</p>

          <p>Regarding incorporating clinical data, you may consider incorporating
          clinical data as a cell state by fine-tuning a relevant cell classifier
          and then using in silico perturbation to identify genes that are important
          for that cell state (e.g. particular disease). Please see the example for
          hyperparameter tuning if you are interested in this type of downstream task
          - this would be analogous to our approach to identifying candidate therapeutic
          targets for cardiomyopathy as presented in the manuscript.</p>

          <p>You can select 10k random cells by first shuffling the dataset and then
