        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! Unfortunately, we are
          unable to reproduce this error. When running with the provided example code
          as is and also when running the code with your modifications (in max_ncells
          and forward_batch_size), the code runs without error (by the way, in the
          future it would be great to paste in the text of your code rather than an
          image so we can directly copy it and ensure we caught all the changes).
          It looks like in your case the code is not able to finish the first batch
          of 50 and encounters this error - is that correct? Could you try changing
          the batch size to check if that''s related?</p>
