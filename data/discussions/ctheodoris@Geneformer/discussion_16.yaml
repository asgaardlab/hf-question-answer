          <p>But I can find the input files:</p>

          <pre><code># load train dataset (includes all tissues)

          <p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. The example notebooks are
          meant to be a generally applicable examples for fine-tuning for gene or
          cell classification, so these lines are where you would supply your own
          tokenized single cell RNAseq data that you are interested in fine-tuning
          the model with. There is not one dataset that is meant to be supplied here.
          Please see the last section of the model card for information about fine-tuning
          and example input files in the dataset repository. If you are interested
          in replicating any of the other gene or cell classification tasks described
          in the manuscript, please email me to request the dataset of interest and
          I would be happy to provide it.</p>
