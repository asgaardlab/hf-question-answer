        html: '<p>Dear Christina,</p>

          <p>I was trying to get the .ipynbs from the example folder running, first.<br>The
          problem, however, is that I do not find any requirements file and therefore
          need to install packages manually, one by one, if they are missing.</p>

          <p>Could you provide the .yaml file, describing the conda environment, or
          the image for the singularity or docker container, in which the notebooks
          would be runnable? </p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer and suggestions! We updated
          setup.py to include the current primary dependencies and recommended Python
          version (though we revised to include capitalized annotations from the typing
          library rather than the built-in collection types for Python &gt;=3.9 so
          it should be compatible with older versions currently). A set of minimum
          requirements have been added to requirements.txt though it is definitely
          possible that earlier version of these packages will work - this has not
          been thoroughly evaluated, but we added this to hopefully provide a more
          defined suggested environment for those that prefer to specify this with
          <code>pip install . -r requirements.txt</code>. Please let us know if you
          encounter any further difficulties and we would be happy to update this
          accordingly. Thank you!</p>
