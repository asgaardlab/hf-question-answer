        html: '<p>Dear Christina, congratulations on this landmark study! Thank you
          for taking the time to respond to all questions! </p>

          <p>I was looking at the list of datasets (Supplementary Table 1) and noticed
          that a substantial fraction of datasets was listed multiple times (presumably
          because the same data was hosted on multiple resources: HCA/GEO/Cellxgene,
          etc). So, perhaps, the actual number of unique cells was less than 27M.
          Could you, please, confirm if this is indeed the case and whether you tested
          the impact of these duplications on the model performance? Thank you in
          advance!</p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your question. Many studies have multiple datasets
          from the same publication that represent different conditions, individuals,
          time points, etc. Additionally, some datasets were very large, and we split
          them into 2 datasets to facilitate processing without running into memory
          constraints (for example the large dataset of fetal cerebrum from Cao et
          al). Matching datasets between different databases (such as Human Cell Atlas,
          Single Cell Portal, etc) to avoid duplicating the data represents a significant
          challenge that we are currently working on automating for future work. However,
          for Genecorpus-30M, to be extremely rigorous, we manually checked every
          single dataset for duplication as well. We also took care to check all preprints
          for newly published peer-reviewed articles to avoid duplications from that
          end. Additionally, because the filtering criteria is deterministic, if datasets
          were duplicated they would have the same number of cells before filtering,
          the same number of cells that passed filtering, and the same citation. As
          you can see from the supplementary table, there are no datasets that match
          across those attributes.</p>
