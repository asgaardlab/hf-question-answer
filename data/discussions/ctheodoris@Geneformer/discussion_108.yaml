        html: '<p>Thank you for such a great model.<br>I''m now trying the perturbation.
          I noticed that in the manuscript, you mentioned you found two genes from
          the cardiomyocytes dataset. But when I''m looking at the excel table, I
          noticed that there are different genes that got similar patterns like GSN
          and PLN. Also there are other genes like KLRD1 that leads to shift to NF,
          non shift to DCM, low FDR and high detection from dataset but seems are
          not related to cardiomyocytes. So I''m curious about the standard when selecting
          genes from the output of perturbation?<br>Thanks!</p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! To be clear for others,
          you are referring to Supplementary Table 12, tab "DCM_del_tx". All genes
          in that table were expressed in the cardiomyocytes. The model prioritized
          candidate therapeutic targets from the &gt;17K detected genes to a couple
          hundred genes. From there, candidates can be selected based on your scientific
          question and experimental setup. For example, since we were testing the
          candidates in an iPSC disease model of DCM, we cross-referenced to genes
          that were expressed in the model cells in vitro so that we could meaningfully
          test inhibiting the candidate in the disease model. Also, for the purposes
          of discovering new biology as a demonstration of the potential of Geneformer
          to accelerate discoveries, we chose not to test genes that may have had
          clear prior knowledge relevant to cardiomyopathy. We also further prioritized
          based on thinking about the biology of each gene and knowledge of the disease
          pathology and which gene may be an effective candidate therapeutic target.
          One may choose to prioritize based on specificity of the expression of that
          gene in cardiomyocytes to avoid potential side effects in other tissues
          where the gene is expressed. One may also choose to prioritize based on
          genes with existing small molecules that target their expression. Alternatively,
          one may choose to test all the candidates predicted by Geneformer to be
          most comprehensive and provide further options for viable treatments. Although
          we tested only a few genes for this experimental validation of Geneformer-predicted
          targets, our collaborators are currently testing the remainder of the Geneformer-predicted
          genes for additional potential therapeutic success.</p>
