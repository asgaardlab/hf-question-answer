          from scratch with a new pretraining corpus other than Genecorpus-30M, could
          we add expression data from cells related to cancer into the dataset? Because
          cancer exists in the real life, and gene expression data may differ between
          normal and cancer cells.  If doing like this, the model may comprehensively
          understand cells in a real world scene. Is that reasonable? </p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your question. As discussed in the manuscript, we
          excluded cells with high mutational burdens (e.g. malignant cells and immortalized
          cell lines) that could lead to substantial network rewiring without companion
          genome sequencing to facilitate interpretation. If many genes are mutated
          such that the proteins have different functions than they normally would,
          this may lead to misinterpretation by the model because it does not have
          the information that the gene it is observing is normal in one cell but
          mutated in another. For example, mutations can lead to gain of function
          that is completely distinct from the normal protein function. Of note, gene
          deletions or extra copies of genes would not be a problem because the change
          is evident in the transcriptome observed by the model (e.g. less counts
          for a gene deletion). We therefore opted to pretrain the model without cells
          with high mutational burdens and allow users to fine-tune the model with
          malignant cells should they be interested in cancer applications and wish
          the model to be tuned to the network rewiring and/or altered gene function
          in that disease state. This is especially important due to the overrepresentation
          of malignant and immortalized cells in publicly available data due to their
          being clinically accessible and easy to culture, respectively. Overall,
          we chose to include less cells that were high quality rather than include
          more cells that may lead to misinterpretation by the model.</p>
