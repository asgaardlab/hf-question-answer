        html: '<p>Hi Christina, could you clarify something for me?</p>

          <p>Below is a plot of the cell embeddings extracted from my model fine-tuned
          using OA data. Can the cosine shift be explained as how far on the coordinate
          plane the diseased cell embedding moves towards the centroid of the healthy
          cells, as indicated in the first plot below? Would a better approach be
          imitating the natural progression of diseased cells, but in reverse, as
          in the second figure?</p>
