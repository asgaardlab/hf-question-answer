          <p>The example notebooks are intended to be generally applicable to downstream
          tasks relevant to gene or cell classification. We added a directory "example_input_files"
          with the example input files for the application of gene classification
          to distinguish dosage sensitivity transcription factors. The labels are
          based on Ni et al 2019, Shihab et al 2017, and Lek et al 2016. The gene
          information is based on the Ensembl database. The "gene_train_data.dataset"
          can be particular cells of interest or you can use the Genecorpus-30M (<a

          from which the example notebook will extract random cells. Please note that
          Genecorpus-30M is a large dataset so loading it for the first time may take
          some time. The Huggingface .dataset format is designed to cache the data
          though so future usage will be faster in that this cache allows Datasets
          to avoid re-processing the entire dataset with each use. The "pretrained_model"
          is Geneformer, which is in the main directory of this repository. </p>

          <p>Regarding the question about anndata: Geneformer takes as input tokenized
          datasets in the Huggingface .dataset format. The transcriptome tokenizer
          ("tokenizer.py") converts loom files to tokenized datasets. For use with
          anndata, we recommend converting the file to the loom format with Anndata

        html: '<p>Thank you for your question. We chose to pretrain Geneformer with
          single cell data due to the increased precision of this data as it measures
          the gene expression within each individual cell as opposed to averaged across
          multiple cells or multiple cell types as in the case of bulk data.  As a
          context-aware model, the predictions are specific to the individual cell
          presented to the model, so presenting the model with single cells best takes
          advantage of this context-awareness. </p>
