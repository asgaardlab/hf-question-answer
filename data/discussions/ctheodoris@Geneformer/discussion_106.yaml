        html: '<p>Thank you so much for the amazing work.<br>According to the tutorial
          (obtain_nonzero_median_digests.ipynb), there are three kinds of .pickle
          files generated, including gene_median_digest_dict.pickle, total_gene_median_dict.pickle,
          and detected_gene_median_dict.pickle.<br>For the purpose of pretraining
          a new model from scratch with a new pretraining corpus other than Genecorpus-30M,
          which one should be used?</p>

          <p>As I understood, the gene_median_digest_dict.pickle is used for a single
          dataset, and the total_gene_median_dict.pickle is generated by merging some
          gene_median_digest_dict.pickle from different datasets. So if I have only
          one dataset, total_gene_median_dict.pickle is the same as the gene_median_digest_dict.pickle,
          right?<br>And the detected_gene_median_dict.pickle saves only detected genes''
          medians by filtering the nan values within the total_gene_median_dict.pickle.<br>So
          the final .pickle file should be used for pretraining is the detected_gene_median_dict.pickle,
          right?</p>
