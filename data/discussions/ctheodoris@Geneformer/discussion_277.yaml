          How should ` Shift_to_goal_end` be interpreted?


          Lets say I''m using `model_type="CellClassifier"` and `perturb_type="delete"`,
          only a `goal state`, all genes.


          1. What does a negative "Shift_to_goal_end" mean? for Gene A, I have a significant
          P-value, and negative Shift_to_goal_end.

          - Does this mean that deletion of Gene A makes the cell more like its start
          state? (i.e. perturbed cell is very similar to start).


          2. What does a positive "Shift_to_goal_end" mean? for Gene B, I have a significant
          P-value, and positive Shift_to_goal_end.

          - Does this mean that deletion of Gene B makes the cell more like its goal
          state? (i.e. the perturbed cell is very similar to goal).


          3. what does a "Shift_to_goal_end" value close to 0 mean? or Gene C, I have
          a significant P-value, and 0 Shift_to_goal_end.

          - Does this mean that deletion of Gene C causes our perturbed cell to be
          identical to both start and goal state?


          4.  Should i just think of this as "closer to 1, closer to goal state. closer
          to -1, closer to start state"?


          Thanks for making the method so accessible!

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! Yes, the three states
          being compared are 1) the original cell, 2) the perturbed cell, and 3) the
          average embedding position of the provided cells within the goal state.
          A perturbation that yields a positive value for "Shift_to_goal_end" is one
          that shifts the cell from its original position to the goal embedding position.
          In other words, within the embedding space, (2) is between (1) and (3).
          Negative values indicate that the shift is away from the goal embedding
          position. In other words, (1) is between (2) and (3). The FDR is the multiple
          hypothesis-corrected p-value. Just like any statistical test, if the mean
          shift magnitude is large but not statistically significant, it''s likely
          very variable, whereas a small shift can still be statistically significant
          if it is less variable. Generally, I would suggest setting a significance
          cut-off, and then ordering by magnitude. Keep in mind, all magnitudes will
          be relatively small given we are only modeling the first step in the perturbation
          (overexpressing or deleting genes without providing the model with the downstream
          consequences), but we are specifically targeting the <em>direction</em>
          of the predicted cosine angle shift to be towards the goal end state.</p>
