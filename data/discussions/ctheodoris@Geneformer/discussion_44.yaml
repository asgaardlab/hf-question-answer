        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. You are correct - the
          effect of an in silico perturbation is modeled by changes in the embeddings
          of potential downstream genes, which we quantify as cosine shifts. To infer
          the directionality of the gene expression changes one would expect, we would
          suggest potentially fine-tuning a model for this task with known perturbations
          as training data. One could also develop another model on top of Geneformer,
          taking the Geneformer embeddings as inputs to a model that explicitly infers
          directional connections between genes. </p>
