        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. You could extract cell
          embeddings from the frozen pretrained model and pass that to any classifier.
          However, the pretrained model was trained with a masked learning objective
          so it would be best fine-tuned towards the cell classification objective
          you are interested in. You can choose to freeze any number of layers (0,
          some, or all) during the fine-tuning. The last layer added during fine-tuning
          is for the classification itself.</p>
