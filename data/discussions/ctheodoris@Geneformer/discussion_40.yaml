        html: '<p>There are some details I don''t understand in the paper. "The rank

          if there is a specific criterion to select the 173,152 cells. And I want

        html: '<p>Thank you for your question. The 173,152 cells were not selected.
          The nonzero median value of expression was calculated across all of the
          cells in Genecorpus-30M, as stated in the Methods of the manuscript. This
          specific sentence is just saying that the 25,424 genes were detected in
          a median of 173,152 cells. Not all genes are detected in every cell, so
          we are just providing information here for the readers to get an idea of
          how many cells expressed each gene in the total vocabulary. We provide the
          code we used to obtain the nonzero medians in the example in the pretraining
          directory in this repository. The calculation from which the (purely informational)
          number 173,152 is derived is also provided there.</p>
