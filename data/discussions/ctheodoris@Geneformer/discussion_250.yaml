        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for such a great work. Could you please specify how to locate
          input data to hyperparameter optimization demo in Genecorpus-30M repo? Is
          it the same as the input data for in silico perturbation analysis demo(human_dcm_hcm_nf.dataset<br>)?
          I see that the input file contains  columns: cell_type (annotation of each
          cell''s type), disease (healthy or disease state), individual (unique ID
          for each patient), length (length of that cell''s rank value encoding).
          If we want to adapt this pipeline to our own scRNA seq data, do you have
          any recommendation of how to prepare the input data? Specifically, if DEG
          is needed to identify disease state per cell? And how  could we derive "length
          of that cell''s rank value encoding" information? Thank you very much!</p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! Yes, the input data you
          referenced is the input data for the hyperparameter optimization example.
          Please see the <a href="https://huggingface.co/ctheodoris/Geneformer/blob/main/examples/tokenizing_scRNAseq_data.ipynb">example</a>
          for tokenizing single cell transcriptomes for how to prepare the input data.
          The output of the tokenization includes the "length" column.</p>

          <p>In the case of the data in human_dcm_hcm_nf.dataset, this data was from
          Chaffin et al. Nature 2022, where the data was annotated based on whether
          it was derived from heart samples of individuals with non-failing hearts,
          individuals affected by dilated cardiomyopathy, or individuals affected
          by hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. As discussed in the manuscript, the fine-tuning
          process allows the model to learn the embedding position of each of these
          healthy or disease states within the embedding space, which then enables
          one to probe the model''s interpretation of these states through in silico
          perturbation to define the genes that shift cells between each state (e.g.
          from dilated cardiomyopathy to healthy, indicating candidate therapeutic
          targets).</p>
