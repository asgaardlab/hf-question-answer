        html: '<p>Hello, first of all I want to congratulate you for the great work
          you have done.<br>I have a dataset of n SNPs from studies carried out on
          patients with a certain cardiac condition. I understand that Geneformer
          was trained with single cell transcriptomic data so my specific question
          is... Is there a way to use a genomic dataset like mine with Geneformer
          to make predictions? Or whenever I want to use the Geneformer model should
          I use data at the transcriptomic level?</p>

          <p>thank you so much</p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer! The input to Geneformer
          is transcriptomic data. If you were to use SNP data, you could do so by

          are interested in using a separate model, and then inputing that data into
          Geneformer. There are potential other ways to do this by adding a vocabulary
