        html: '<p>Hello. Thank you for this amazing tool!<br>I am trying to replicate
          the results of in silico perturbation of GATA4 and TBX5. I see the original
          literature from which the direct targets are published is cited, and so
          I obtained the ChIP-seq signals for these two TFs from the original literature.
          Due to my limited experience of handling ChIP-seq data, I am unsure how
          to extract the direct and indirect targets of the TFs from the ChIP-seq
          data. I am wondering if there is a list of target genes of GATA4 and TBX5
          as an easy reference? Forgive me for my inexperience, and I am happy to
          clarify if there is any question :)<br>Thank you in advance! </p>
