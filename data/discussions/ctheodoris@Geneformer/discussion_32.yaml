        html: '<p>Thank you for your interest in Geneformer. In the manuscript we
          demonstrated multiple zero-shot learning applications of the model including
          determining transcription factor targets. However, if you have additional
          task-specific data, fine-tuning towards your downstream task would generally
          improve results. If you are asking whether it''s possible to fine-tune the
          model with bulk RNA-seq data as the input, we have not evaluated that, but
          it may be possible. The bulk data would be tokenized to the maximum input
          size of the model. </p>
