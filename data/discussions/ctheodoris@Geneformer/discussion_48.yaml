        html: '<p>Hi, will you be including all of your code in order to replicate
          your analyses from your paper for validation purposes and to understand
          the technical work better?  Also, I may be misunderstanding here but you
          do not include all of the code/data needed to replicate your examples. For
          example, for the dosage sensitivity test there''s no gene_train_data.dataset
          that''s needed as the training dataset. Or for the bivalent chromatin section,
          you''ve given the data but not the code used for the analysis. Any help
          on getting the model up and running would be appreciated thanks.</p>

          Table 2 in the manuscript for which labels and data we used for each application.
          The examples in the examples folder here are meant to be general examples
          where you can substitute the data and labels for those relevant to the task
          you would like to fine tune towards. Specifically for the dosage sensitivity,
          as noted in Supplementary Table 2 in the manuscript, you can use 10K random
          cells from Genecorpus-30M. Also, this analysis has been replicated by others
