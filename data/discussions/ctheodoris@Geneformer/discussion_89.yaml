          <p>Now I want to train/test my own data.<br>First, I have to change the
          gene name to  ensembl_id.<br>In this file <strong>gene_info_table.csv</strong>,
          most of the genes hase unique ensembl_id, but some of them have multiple
          ensembl_ids.<br>Can I just pick the first one for these genes having multiple
          ensembl_ids? Could you give some suggestions?</p>

          <p>Thanks !!!</p>
