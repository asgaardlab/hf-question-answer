          <p>However in your screenshot it looks more like it''s something else in
          your text-generation-webui that it''s detecting, rather than this model
          file?  Hard to tell as I can''t see all the details in that screenshot,
          but it''s pointing to <code>oobabooga_windows\installer_files\env</code>
          - the model would go to the <code>models</code> folder, not the <code>env</code>
          folder.  <code>env</code> contains your conda Python environment for text-generation-webui,
          meaning it contains all the Python packages that text-generation-webui installs
          in order to make it work.</p>

          <p> It''s probably still a false positive, but you should check to see what
          files specifically it claims are infected. There are plenty of Python scripts
          in text-generation-webui which could theoretically contain malware (though
          malware in Python scripts is not at all common).</p>

          <p>But this model itself cannot be the source.</p>
