          <p>I considered PIPPA, but wanted to minimize the amount of GPT-isms, and

          <p>It uses a ChatML format, although it seems that it might not like system

          <p>Awesome.</p>

          <p>Soon I''m going to be making a version that does rank finetuning (something
          sorta like DPO or PRO) over preference data from r/WritingPrompts. Also
          probably will include posts from r/ShortStories, and will also use oasst2.</p>
