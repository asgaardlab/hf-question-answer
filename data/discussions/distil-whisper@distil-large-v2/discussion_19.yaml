        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>First of all, thanks for the great work.  I''d like to have a quick evaluation
          of this with <code>whipser.cpp</code>.  The released model''s filename <code>ggml-large-32-2.en.bin</code>
          indicates it''s English only.  Is there an all-language distil-large-v2
          model?    </p>
