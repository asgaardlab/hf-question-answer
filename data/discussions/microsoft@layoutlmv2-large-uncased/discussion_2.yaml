        html: '<p>Hi everyone, </p>

          <p>I hope you all are doing well, and good in health. I am working on LayoutLMv2
          and LayoutLMv3, and for this reason, I have been working on these topics
          for the last 2 months, our main objective is to extract the key feature
          from the Invoices using the LayoutLM models where I have the already labeled
          dataset for this, but here I am using the pre-trained model try to train
          on the custom dataset. and then after training, I want to store the weights
          of that model, and then load these weights to test the model. currently,
          I am facing some difficulties in that phase, and I am confused can we use
          that commercially or not if not why? if yes or there is a possible way to
          do that then what are the steps for that? </p>

          <p>Thanks, Hassan javed</p>
