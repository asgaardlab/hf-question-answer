        html: '<p>Hi, I''m just a fan. i use only tex generation web ui. I tried dozens
          and dozens of modules. and finally with this legacy-ggml-vicuna-13b-4bit
          I am very happy and satisfied. The assistant responds well, courteous, prepared.
          and available for anything.<br>The only problem I have (and it only happens
          to me with this module) is that at a certain point it stops and this error
          appears OSError: exception: access violation reading 0xFFFFFFFFFFFFFFFF
          . As I said it only happens to me with this module. I''m not good with codes,
          if you explain me step by step I can try to solve the problem. Thanks</p>
