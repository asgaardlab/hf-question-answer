        html: '<p>I appreciate that this has only been tested on Nvidia, but I have
          an AMD 7800XT and am getting really weird results with any GPU offload enabled.
          The text is barely related to the instruction and makes bizarre diversions.
          It works fine on CPU.</p>

          <p>I''m using LM Studio on Windows. Is anyone else experiencing this or
          do you have any hints? Thanks</p>
