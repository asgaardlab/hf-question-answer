          \ There are three killers in a room. Someone enters the room and kills one\
          \ of them. Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are left in the room?\
          \ Explain your reasoning step by step.\n [/INST] The answer is that there\
          \ are still three killers in the room. Here's why:\n\n1. Initially, we have\
          \ three killers in the room (A, B, and C).\n2. Then, another person enters\
          \ the room and kills one of them, let's say A. This means that the number\
          \ of killers decreases by one, but at the same time, the person who entered\
          \ becomes a killer too.\n3. So, even though one original killer (A) has\
          \ been removed from the equation, they have been replaced by the new entrant\
          \ who is also a killer.\n4. Therefore, the total count of killers remains\
          \ the same, which is three (B, C, and the new entrant).\n\n&gt;  &lt;s&gt;[INST]\
          \ Mark is faster than Mary , Mary is faster than Joe. Is Joe faster than\
          \ Mark?\n [/INST] No, Joe is not faster than Mark based on the given information.\
          \ Here's why:\n\n1. We know that Mark is faster than Mary.\n2. We also know\
          \ that Mary is faster than Joe.\n3. If Mark were slower than Mary, then\
          \ it would be possible for him to be slower than Joe as well, but since\
          \ we are told that Mark is faster than Mary, this isn't the case.\n4. Given\
          \ these two pieces of information, Mark remains faster than both Mary and\
          \ Joe. Thus, Joe cannot be faster than Mark in this scenario.\n\n&gt;  &lt;s&gt;[INST]\
          \ If I lay 2 wet shirts out in the sun flat on the ground to dry and it\
          \ takes 5 hours until they are dry, how long would it take to dry 4 shirts\
          \ of the same type that way simultanously?\n [/INST] Assuming that you lay\
          \ all four wet shirts out in the sun at the same time and they all receive\
          \ an equal amount of sunlight, then each shirt will take the same amount\
          \ of time to dry as one shirt does. In this case, since two shirts took\
          \ 5 hours to dry, drying four shirts should still take 5 hours.\n\nHere's\
          \ the step-by-step reasoning:\n1. Two wet shirts dried in 5 hours when laid\
          \ out individually.\n2. When laying out multiple items for drying, as long\
          \ as they receive equal exposure to sunlight, their drying time does not\
          \ increase due to being placed together (assuming similar conditions).\n\
          3. Therefore, if you lay four wet shirts out simultaneously and evenly spaced\
          \ in the same conditions, each shirt should still take 5 hours to dry because\
          \ they are receiving an equal amount of sunlight as the two shirts did before.\n\
          \nSo, it would take 5 hours to dry 4 shirts if laid out simultaneously under\
          \ similar conditions.\n\n&gt;  &lt;s&gt;[INST] explain step by step 25-4*2+3=?\n\
          \ [/INST] Let's break down the given expression step by step, following\
          \ the order of operations (PEMDAS):\n\nExpression: 25 - 4 * 2 + 3\n\nStep\
          \ 1: Parentheses and Exponents (none in this case)\nStep 2: Multiplication\
          \ and Division (from left to right)\n   - Perform multiplication first:\
          \ 4 * 2 = 8\n\nNew Expression: 25 - 8 + 3\n\nStep 3: Addition and Subtraction\
          \ (from left to right)\n   - First, perform subtraction: 25 - 8 = 17\n\n\
          New Expression: 17 + 3\n\nStep 4: Perform the final addition\n   - Lastly,\
          \ add the remaining numbers: 17 + 3 = 20\n\nTherefore, the result of the\
          \ given expression is 20.\n\nExpression: 25 - 4 * 2 + 3 = 20\n\n&gt;  &lt;s&gt;[INST]\n\

          \  &lt;s&gt;[INST] There are two ducks in front of a duck, two ducks behind\
          \ a duck and a duck in the middle. How many ducks are there?\n [/INST] There\
          \ are five ducks in total. Here's how we can figure this out:\n\n1. We have\
          \ two ducks in front of another duck, which means one duck has two ducks\
          \ in front of it.\n2. Similarly, there are two ducks behind another duck,\
          \ indicating that one duck has two ducks behind it.\n3. Then, there is a\
          \ duck placed in the middle, between the first mentioned group (two ducks\
          \ in front) and the second mentioned group (two ducks behind).\n4. So, if\
          \ we count all these ducks together, we have:\n   - Two ducks in front\n\
          \   - One duck in the middle\n   - Two ducks behind\n5. Adding them up,\

          \ simultanously?\n [/INST] Assuming that you lay all four wet shirts out\
          \ in the sun at the same time and they all receive an equal amount of sunlight,\
          \ then each shirt will take the same amount of time to dry as one shirt\
          \ does. In this case, since two shirts took 5 hours to dry, drying four\
          \ shirts should still take 5 hours.\n\nHere's the step-by-step reasoning:\n\
          1. Two wet shirts dried in 5 hours when laid out individually.\n2. When\
          \ laying out multiple items for drying, as long as they receive equal exposure\
          \ to sunlight, their drying time does not increase due to being placed together\
          \ (assuming similar conditions).\n3. Therefore, if you lay four wet shirts\

          \ should still take 5 hours to dry because they are receiving an equal amount\
          \ of sunlight as the two shirts did before.\n\nSo, it would take 5 hours\

    \ looking tree in Python using the Turtle graphics library and a recursive algorithm.\n\
    \ [/INST] Here's a Python program using the Turtle module that generates a simple,\
    \ yet realistic-looking tree using a recursive algorithm:\n\nimport turtle\n\n\
    def draw_branch(length, angle, t):\n    if length <= 5:\n        return\n\n  \
    \  # Draw the branch\n    t.forward(length)\n\n    # Change the drawing direction\
    \ and pencil width for the next branches\n    t.right(angle)\n    draw_branch(length\
    \ * 0.67, angle, t)\n    t.left(2 * angle)\n    draw_branch(length * 0.67, angle,\
    \ t)\n    t.right(angle)\n\n    # Move the turtle back to the starting point of\
    \ the branch\n    t.backward(length)\n\ndef main():\n    window = turtle.Screen()\n\
    \    window.bgcolor(\"skyblue\")\n    window.title(\"Turtle Tree\")\n\n    my_turtle\
    \ = turtle.Turtle()\n    my_turtle.speed(0)\n    my_turtle.pencolor(\"brown\"\
    )\n\n    # Draw the trunk of the tree\n    my_turtle.right(90)\n    my_turtle.forward(150)\n\
    \    my_turtle.right(90)\n\n    # Move the turtle to start drawing the branches\n\
    \    my_turtle.penup()\n    my_turtle.backward(150)\n    my_turtle.pendown()\n\
    \n    # Draw the first level of branches\n    draw_branch(100, 25, my_turtle)\n\
    \n    turtle.done()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n\nThis program\
    \ creates a simple tree using the Turtle graphics library and recursion. The `draw_branch`\
    \ function takes care of drawing each branch and its sub-branches, while the main\
    \ function sets up the Turtle environment and initializes the turtle to draw the\
    \ trunk and branches. By changing the parameters of the `draw_branch` function,\
    \ you can easily adjust the appearance of the tree to your liking. The `turtle.done()`\
    \ call is essential for the turtle graphics window to remain open after running\
    \ the script.\n\n>  <s>[INST] Create a webpage with css and javascript in one\

          <p>Yes I am really curious if it is good at chat as well if so we might
          have a current winner lol at this rate give it a month or less and we might
          have an open source model that answers all the above questions 100% correctly.</p>

          <p>Without logic and reasoning a model is pretty much dreaming, hallucinating
          up the answers.</p>

          <p>Things become interesting and might be a bit scary when it does logic
          and reasoning very well and it can start to really think run simulations/visualize
          outcomes and only when the simulation and visualization is a success it
          will describe it perfectly step by step we are very close to AGI.</p>

          <p>Why would a dead killer not be a killer anymore? Once you have killed
          you have two variants a dead killer or alive killer both are still killers
          just alive killer can murder more while a dead killer cannot but just because
          you cannot kill anymore does not mean your past as a killer did not happen
          your still a killer. The same thing if a rapist rapes someone and then never
          does it again for whatever reason it is still a rapist based on a past action
          or actions.</p>

          <p>If a victim dies because of a killer that victim is no longer a victim
          with that logic you could as well release the killer because there is no
          longer a victim</p>

          <p>If a man or woman dies does that mean they are no longer a man or woman?</p>

          <p>The questions should be changed and be more specific then how many killers
          are still alive in the room but if the question is not specific enough the
          anwer is 4 killers in the room dead or alive does not matter because it
          is not stated if they should be alive or dead.</p>

          <p>Could you explain further how the answer might be different?</p>

          <p>YOU:</p>

          <p>The person entering the room by killing one of the three killers became
          a killer himself bringing the total people in the room to 4 and they are
          all killers which means there is 4 killers in the room now we group them
          in two groups group killers alive and group killers dead</p>

          <p>Group alive 3 killers<br>Group dead 1 killer</p>

          <p>All 4 people where at one point all Killers but one of the 4 Killers
          died so you end up with those two groups do you understand now?<br>ChatGPT</p>

          <p>Ah, I see! Your reasoning considers the person who entered the room and
          killed one of the killers as effectively becoming a killer themselves, hence
          making all four individuals in the room killers.</p>

          <p>So, following this line of thought:</p>

          <pre><code>Killers Alive in the Room: 3 (the initial killers who were alive)

          Killers Dead in the Room: 1 (the killer who was killed by the person entering
          the room)

          </code></pre>

          <p>Your explanation clarifies that all four individuals are now considered
          killers at some point in the scenario, even though one was killed later.
          Thank you for the clarification!<br>User<br>How many killers are in the
          room now it does not matter if they are alive or dead?<br>ChatGPT</p>

          <p>If we''re counting both the living and the dead individuals who were
          killers at any point in the scenario, then there would be a total of 4 killers
          in the room.</p>

        html: "<blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>YOU:<br>There are three killers alive\
          \ in a room. Someone enters the room and kills one of them. Nobody leaves\
          \ the room. How many killers are still alive in the room and how many killers\
          \ are dead? Explain your reasoning step by step.<br>ChatGPT</p>\n<p>Let's\
          \ break this down step by step:</p>\n<p>Initially, there are three killers\
          \ alive in the room. When someone enters and kills one of them, it's important\
          \ to note the scenario:</p>\n<pre><code>Initial Situation:\n    Killers\
          \ alive: 3\n    Total in the room: 3\n\nSomeone enters and kills one of\
          \ them:\n    Killers alive: Initially 3, but now 2 after one is killed.\n\
          \    Total in the room: 3 (the two remaining killers + the person who entered\
          \ and killed one)\n</code></pre>\n<p>However, the question specifically\
          \ asks about the number of killers alive and dead after the killing takes\
          \ place. Here's the breakdown:</p>\n<pre><code>Killers Alive: After the\
          \ killing, there are still 2 killers left alive in the room.\nKillers Dead:\
          \ One killer was killed by the person who entered the room.\n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>So, to answer your question:</p>\n<pre><code>Killers Alive in the Room:\
          \ 2\nKillers Dead in the Room: 1\n</code></pre>\n<p>Well clearly ChatGPT\
          \ 3.5 Turbo fails very badly does not even know that person that entered\
          \ the room became a killer that is alive as well lol but at least it counted\
          \ one dead killer.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>I asked second time in a new seasion</p>\n\
          <pre><code>There are three killers alive in a room. Someone enters the room\
          \ and kills one of them. Nobody leaves the room. How many killers are still\
          \ alive in the room and how many killers are dead? Explain your reasoning\
          \ step by step.\n [/INST] Let's break this down step by step:\n\n1. Initially,\
          \ there are three killers in the room (A, B, C).\n2. Another person enters\
          \ the room and kills one of them (let's say A), but doesn't leave.\n3. Now,\
          \ we have to consider that the person who entered and committed a murder\
          \ is also a killer.\n4. Therefore, after the first killer (A) was killed\
          \ by the new entrant, there were three killers in total - two original ones\
          \ (B and C) and one new killer (the person who came in and killed A).\n\
          5. Since no one left the room, all three killers are still present in the\
          \ room.\n6. As for how many killers are dead, it's important to note that\
          \ only one killer (A) has been killed.\n\nSo, there are three killers alive\
          \ and one killer dead in the room.\n\n&gt;  &lt;s&gt;[INST] \n</code></pre>\n\
          <p>I think eastly outperform gpt 3.5 and is a very close to gpt 4.</p>\n\
          </blockquote>\n<p>This point: 5. Since no one left the room, all three killers\

          \ direction of the snake, and avoid colliding with the borders or its own\
          \ body. The game will end if the snake hits either the border or its own\
          \ body. The current score is displayed at the top right corner.\n\nYou can\
          \ customize the canvas size, box size, starting position, and initial direction\
          \ by editing the variables near the top of the JavaScript code.\n\n&gt;\

          <p>Interesting. I just watched a video where Mixtral 8x7B got this question
          correct (4 including the dead killer). I used hugging face chat, which I
          suppose means they might be using the quantized model which might produce
          slightly less reliable results? Overall though, it answers tough LLM questions
          better than 3.5-turbo.. but in benchmarks it was slightly lower ranked (&lt;1%).
          Despite the inconsistency, it is very impressive how far free and open source
          options have came!</p>

          <p>I suspect most 7b high rank models are more or less  contaminated ( we
          need better tests ... ) because from my own tests any 7b,13,34,79b is not
          even close in reasoning, trueful , arc, math , programming  comparing to
          this MoE model.</p>
