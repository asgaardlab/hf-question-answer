        html: '<p>Hello everyone,<br>I have encountered a rather serious error with
          my Ssd External Hard Disk,</p>

          <p>Being that I have a laptop go wanted to download the program inside an
          External storage,</p>

          <p>My External Hard Disk: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.westerndigital.com/it-it/products/portable-drives/sandisk-extreme-pro-usb-3-2-ssd?sku=SDSSDE81-1T00-G25">https://www.westerndigital.com/it-it/products/portable-drives/sandisk-extreme-pro-usb-3-2-ssd?sku=SDSSDE81-1T00-G25</a></p>

          <p>I started "run.bat" and "run_realistic.bat"</p>

          <p>I started the Download, When the Download ended it told me to update
          my graphics card.</p>

          <p>I updated my Graphics Card correctly, I restarted the Computer and started
          "run.bat" and "run_realistic.bat" again, they started correctly, I created
          two images then it stopped working.</p>

          <p>I restarted the Computer again and when it turned on it came out:<br>"The
          Volume Does Not Contain a Recognized File System..."</p>

          <p>I leave attached the image of the error</p>

          <p>I gave my external memory to fix, needless to say I have very important
          files in it.</p>

          <p>Can you tell me how this happened ?<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6595eb24665c29891f5c6fbc/d4LifqT7la6UsiYnkTLVa.png"><img
