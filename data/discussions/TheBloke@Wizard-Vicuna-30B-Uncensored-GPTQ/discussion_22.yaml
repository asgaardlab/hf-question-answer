        html: '<p>I would like some help, I believe there must be a way to load the
          model via TGI, but whenever I try it returns the following error:</p>

          <pre><code class="language-Log">RuntimeError: weight gptq_bits does not
          exist

          </code></pre>

          <p>is there any way to load the quant models in TGI? it is a good solution
          for my use because it allows multiple simultaneous requests different from
          TGWEBUI, or is there any way to multiple requests in TGWEBUI? I have doubts
          about it</p>
