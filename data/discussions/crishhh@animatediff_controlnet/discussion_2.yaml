        html: '<p>Thanks for your attention, the SDXL version I am still working on.
          This controlnet is specifically finetuned for animatediff whose purpose
          is to keep the initial image appearance in the process of animation. It
          performance is unstable when compared to the tile controlnet,  because the
          train dataset is less than tile controlnet.  When you use it for animation,
          I recommend you use the less motion version for its stable performance.</p>
