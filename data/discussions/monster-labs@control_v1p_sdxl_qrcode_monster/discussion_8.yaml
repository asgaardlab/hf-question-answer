        html: '<p>Hi guys,</p>

          <p>i''m having a hard time getting good strong subject isolation like i
          had with 1.5 version of QR Monster, previously, i was able to create logos
          and text with just plain black subject on white background such as this
          exemple<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6305107b8d7f39c0ecf2e77e/wFCP3y2D6ZYf7aRMUVQx2.png"><img

          <p>But with SDXL, it seems to work differently, i tried up to 2 in weight,
          i used twice the same QRcode controlnet in A1111 which leads to monstrous
          results. It seems that the SDXL version has less impact on the generation
          and doesn''t act like a mask as the 1.5</p>

          <p>Any suggestion is welcome.</p>

          <p>EDIT : After more experimentation, i found this recipe to work well,
          QRCode at 0.25 and Zoe depth at 0.5 :)</p>
