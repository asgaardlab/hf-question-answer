        html: '<p>I am reaching out to you with a request to train your chat language
          model with a specific dataset to enhance its Sinhala language capabilities.</p>

          <p>Dataset Information:</p>

          <p>Dataset Name: Eng-Sinhala Translation Dataset<br>Size: Approximately
          80,000 lines of English-Sinhala translation pairs<br>Dataset Link: Eng-Sinhala
          Translation Dataset<br>Data License: GPL (GNU General Public License)</p>

          <p>I have recently created a dataset consisting of English-Sinhala translation
          pairs to address the lack of Sinhala knowledge in your chat language model.
          The dataset aims to improve the model''s ability to engage in conversations
          and provide accurate responses in Sinhala.</p>

          <p>Considering the large size of the dataset, I have already trained a separate
          language model using this dataset, which has yielded promising results.
          However, I believe that incorporating this dataset into your existing chat
          language model will further enhance its Sinhala language understanding and
          make it more valuable for users who communicate in Sinhala.</p>

          <p>I kindly request your assistance in training your chat language model
          with the provided Eng-Sinhala Translation Dataset. By doing so, you can
          help expand the model''s language capabilities and make it more inclusive
          for Sinhala-speaking users.</p>

          <p>I understand that training a language model requires expertise and computational
          resources, which might not be readily available to me. Therefore, I seek
          your support and collaboration in this endeavor.</p>

          <p>I am happy to provide the dataset files (src.txt and tgt.txt) to facilitate
          the training process. Additionally, the dataset is available for download
          from the provided link, ensuring transparency and easy access for other
          researchers and developers interested in Sinhala language processing.</p>

          <p>Files:</p>

          <p>src.txt: This file contains the source sentences in English. Each line
          corresponds to an English sentence.<br>tgt.txt: This file contains the target
          sentences in Sinhala. Each line corresponds to the Sinhala translation of
          the corresponding English sentence in src.txt.</p>
