        html: '<p>The example images are available to <a href="https://huggingface.co/joujiboi/Weri-Diffusion/tree/main">download</a>
          just like the actual model, the name of the image contains most of the prompt
          but if you want to know the full prompt you can download them then use the
          <code>PNG info</code> tab in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic111
          WebUI</a>.</p>

          <p>As for using the model, I''m not sure why you''re getting an error on
          whatever you''re using the model on but if you use the <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui">Automatic111
          WebUI</a> you should be able to put the model in the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/BDPWvYS.png">Stable-diffusion
          folder</a> inside the <code>models</code> folder and it will work so long
          as you have the Weri-Diffusion model <a rel="nofollow" href="https://i.imgur.com/gALzcRt.png">selected</a>.</p>
