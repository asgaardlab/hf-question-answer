        html: '<p>Hello, I am interested in using your Codet5 model for code similarity
          tasks. I have a question about how to use it in test mode when I have only
          two code snippets to compare.</p>

          <p>According to the CodexGlue dataset format, you expect a list of codes
          and you return the top n most similar examples to a given query. But what
          if I want to check the similarity between two specific code snippets? How
          can I use your model for that?</p>

          <p>Can you please provide a way to get a similarity score (maybe a probability)
          or a binary output (0 or 1) if two code snippets are similar or different?
          For example, given these two code snippets:</p>

          <pre><code>public int f() { return 0;}

          </code></pre>

          <pre><code>public void f() { int i = 0; }

          </code></pre>

          <p>Can your model tell me how similar they are, or if they are equivalent
          or not?<br>Thank you for your help and your great work!</p>
