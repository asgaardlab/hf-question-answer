        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>I''m working on creating an AI assistant similar to OpenAI''s with Mistral.
          Initially, I''m focusing on replicating OpenAI''s thread system, which involves
          using old message storage and embeddings. This approach is to avoid storing
          all messages in lengthy conversations.</p>

          <p>I plan to use the completion API for this task. Hosting my own version
          of Mistral 7B / 8x7B is an option, but it seems unnecessary for my current
          needs. I can easily generate completions and embeddings using the platform
          API, but I''m unsure how to incorporate my embeddings into the completion
          requests.</p>

          <p>Could anyone advise on how to do this? Am I understanding the use of
          embeddings correctly in the context of the platform API?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for your help. I''m new to using AI models, and
          any guidance or resources for learning would be greatly appreciated. :)</p>
