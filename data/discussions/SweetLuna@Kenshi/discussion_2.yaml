        html: '<p>I know its still in testing but I want to give feedback on how it
          handles nudity. It often adds lingerie even if I didn''t prompt it in. Tried
          other prompts that''s should be quite nsfw but what it gave out was quite
          tame instead. Other than that.. the model is great. Just not beginner friendly
          though as it needs abit of tweaking here and there.</p>
