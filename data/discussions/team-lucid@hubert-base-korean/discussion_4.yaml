        html: '<p>Thanks for your interest.</p>

          <p>We used TPU v3-8 to train our model and it took about 40 and 84 hours
          for phase 1 and phase 2 of the base model, respectively.<br>I don''t know
          how long it will take in other cases because the environment I used is not
          common called JAX.</p>
