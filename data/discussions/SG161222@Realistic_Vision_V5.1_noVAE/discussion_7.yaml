          I''ve tried the latent upscaler with very limited success. It produces a

          Simply increasing the initial resolution results in multiple objects being
          generated side by side.

          Now i have noticed something on the readme page:


          Hires. fix with 4x-UltraSharp upscaler

          0 Hires steps and Denoising strength 0.25-0.7

          Upscale by 1.1-2.0


          What does this refer to and how do i utilize this?
