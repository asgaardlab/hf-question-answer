        html: '<p>Hey, really admiring your work here!<br>I just have a question concerning
          the training of a single character LoRA with multiple styles in particular.<br>I
          am currently trying to train a character from ''last origin'' (saraqael),
          but the images are limited (who would have thought) and I want to preserve
          the option to be able to pick the character either with wings or without.
          My progress has been ok so far, however the wings still bleed over to the
          non-wing style.<br>How are you able to better separate multiple styles?</p>

          <p>Things I use:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>training model: novelai</li>

          <li>regularization (class: 1girl)</li>

          <li>booru tagging/tuning every training image</li>

          <li>inserting rare tag at the beginning, so two rare tags in total for two
          styles</li>

          <li>pruning each style so the outfit will be embedded into the rare tag.
          Also pruning ''wings'' for the wing-style.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>As I can''t find any other source about this on the internet, your help
          is much appreciated!</p>

          <p>Y-Axis: Epochs, X-Axis: Prompt<br>Note: The halo or whatever is connected
          to the wings and as such shouldn''t be visible in the nowings-style (saranofly)<br><a
