          <p>I noticed most lora models you shared are of ~150M, assuming you''re
          using a large R in lora training (128?).<br>While based on discussion here:
          <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/cloneofsimo/lora/discussions/37">https://github.com/cloneofsimo/lora/discussions/37</a>
          it seems lora generalize well with r = 4 / 8.</p>

          <p>Have you done experiments that use a R like 4 / 8 for model size around
          10M? It''ll be much easier for runtime model switch and sharing.</p>
