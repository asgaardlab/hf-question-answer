          <p>I''m fairly new to this LORA training and i''m stuck(not literally) on
          one of the process which is image captioning . I  walkthrough a tutorial
          from Aitrepreneur and in his video he used BLIP captioning to do the job
          and modified it to get the accurate result. </p>

          <p>The problem start here, in his tutorial, he used captions like " a woman
          wearing a black jacket and a white shirt etc...." So as for the Anime Characters
          or styles do i used this the one in the tutorial or use danbooru tags ?<br><a
