        html: '<p>Firstly, very nice work on the LoRAs.</p>

          <p>I am quite new to messing about in Stable Diffusion but making some good
          CG style realistic images.<br>I''m trying my hand at more Anime images with
          your LoRAs. They are very impressive.</p>

          <p>Anyway, I have what is probably a noob question but I would appreciate
          if you could help.<br>I''ll use the Genshin Impact Eula image of yours below
          as a reference.</p>

          <p>I dropped your image into Stable Diffusion and sent it all to Text2Img.<br>I
          checked the model hash and believe you used AbyssOrangeMix2NSFW?</p>

          <p>When I try to recreate the image it comes very close but mine looks "washed
          out" and the colour is more flat.</p>

          <p>Do I need to use a VAE in Settings? And if so which one is good?</p>

          <p>Also my LoRAs are on that new tab so when you click it (its no longer
          a drop down box), it instead adds an extra tag in the prompt box e.g. "<a
          rel="nofollow">lora:eulaHard:1</a>".<br>Does the position of this prompt
          effect the outcome in anyway as I have just left it as the last prompt.</p>

          <p>Any help would be appreciated.<br>Cheers.</p>
