          <p>These are fantastic. I have only just started testing building custom
          models and this was the first LoRA one I have seen. I have seen you comment
          elsewhere you don''t share your training images. But I thought I might ask
          how many images you used and where you sourced them? How many attempts/tries
          did it take you to arrive at these results?</p>

        html: '<p>Image count doesn''t really matter, unless it''s too low. I can
          get good model with 40 images or with 3000. Done like 12+ tests on various
          datasets/concepts to find every potentially good setting and I just train
          with the one that works in almost all cases. If the results aren''t great
          for my liking, I just change settings and try again. If they don''t work,
          my dataset sucks. You can get the images from any source you want really.
          Most LoRAs here are first attempts, I had a bit of practice with model finetuning/dreambooths
          so I already know what to change/look for or how to train. With this amount
          of LoRA. I''m not chasing perfection like most people that will do 1 or
          2 of them. I just go with 80/20 rule for most of them.</p>
