        html: '<p>I love MLP, and I watch it a lot with my daughter. She''s gonna
          be so surprised about the voices, plus it''s a great way to introduce her
          to cool technology and tools.</p>

          <p>Thanks so much for posting this fellow Brony. :)</p>

          <p>PS I got it working in voice-changer on my M1 Mac Max w/64GB RAM with
          somewhat decent results. It was a pain to make it work, but it does work!
          Would be happy to share access if anyone is interested.</p>

          <p>Cheers,<br>Preston</p>
