          <p>Ha many thanks for the push. Datasets are just being finalized and models
          will be trained this week.<br>I spent some time experimenting with pretraining
          the 7b model on a large German corpus to increase generation quality but
          this will probably only be ready for the next model version afterwarfds.
          </p>

          <p>Which quantizations/formats are most important? Will try to publish different
          gptq/gguf versions and 7b/13b/34b versions this time.</p>
