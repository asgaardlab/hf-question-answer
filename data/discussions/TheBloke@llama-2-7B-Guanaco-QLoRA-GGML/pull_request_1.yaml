        html: '<p>Just correcting a minor typo in the creator name.</p>

          <p>Also thank you for quantizing these. I didn''t really expect much attention,
          given that I didn''t advertise the finetunes at all.<br>I have also finetuned
          a 13b model in case you want to quantize that as well.</p>

          <p>Also I''m currently finetuning the 70b model (because I''m too much of
          a completionist to leave that out) I''m not sure how that will go given
          the architecture differences present but I am using a transformers version
          that supports llama-2 so fingers crossed it turns out alright.</p>
