        html: '<p>That sounds very useful, but imagine you have a dozen such ambiguities,
          due to combinatorial explosion you get thousands of valid interpretations.
          How do you get any form of usable output out of something like that?</p>

          <p>One solution I can see is to have inline variants. e.g.,  </p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>The <strong>[book is|books are]</strong> on the table.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>This would not be useful for the use case of "just clean up the text
          for me", but would be helpful for a GUI type editor to offer the alternative
          in a dropdown, and the default being the first option. Maybe a secondary
          prompt format could trigger such a formatting.</p>
