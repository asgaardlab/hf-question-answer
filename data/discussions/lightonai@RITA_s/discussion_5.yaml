        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I noticed that the dimensionality of mode_output.hidden_states is [1,
          {context_size}, 768], which I expected to be [12, {context_size}, 768] like
          GPT models. I''m assuming it only returns the representation of the last
          hidden layer.<br>I would like to know how to obtain the hidden representations
          in all 12 layers instead of only the last layer.</p>

          <p>I appreciate your help!</p>
