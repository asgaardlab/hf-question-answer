          <p>First of all, congrats on the very impressive work &amp; thanks for open
          sourcing the model weights &amp; providing the colab demo for using this
          model.</p>

          <p>Is there any scope to fine tune this model? Can a colab demo be provided
          using <code>trl</code> that shows us how to instruct fine tune this model
          for custom function calling use cases? </p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

        html: '<p>Hi Vikram! </p>

          <p>Thank you for your interest! SFT itself can go pretty far, and performing
          SFT is pretty easy with Raven. I''d recommend curating some prompt-completion
          pairs for your APIs/functions using the same prompting style (including
          the special tokens) as shown in the README/colab demo and just performing
          simple supervised fine-tuning on your pairs (ideally with loss only on the
          completions). It should work well, and likely would only need a few samples
          to fit robustly to your APIs/functions with the same prompting style.</p>

          <p>If there is interest in this, we can perhaps create some simple SFT examples
          and add it to Github. Also, please do join our <a rel="nofollow" href="https://discord.gg/HDSVmNAs3y">Discord
          Channel</a>, we''d love to keep up as you try out your experiments! </p>

          <p>Thanks again!</p>
