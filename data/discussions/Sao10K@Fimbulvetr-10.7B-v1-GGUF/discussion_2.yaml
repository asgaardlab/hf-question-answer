        html: '<p>So on the good front - this model merges the smarts of Frostwind,
          with improved prose (that was REALLY dry in frostwind for some reason).
          </p>

          <p>Which actually it makes it the best current Solar Instruct model that
          I know of.  Yay!</p>

          <p>However, it''s prose despite being improved are pretty GPT-ish, down
          to the ''ministrations'' and ''connections''. And those common GPT phrases
          drive some folks, myself included a bit mad. That is to say, there''s definately
          room to improve the prose, despite this being, for now, the best solar instruct
          there is for RP. Specifically not just the GPTisms, but could use more descriptive
          and verbose language -obviously in the non-poetic way, but more punchy and
          compelling adjective use to describe actions and the scene. When punchy
          unexpected adjectives and descriptions start flying it gives the writing
          an edge - that''s missing here. </p>

          <p> I dislike giving that criticism because as it currently stands it''s
          the best model for RP, my GPU can reasonably run. And I''m grateful for
          that. But I know this base model must be capable of more, and maybe you
          appreciate the feedback IDK. </p>

          <p>Rambling possibly irrelevant side note: Actually the best solar instruct
          merge I''ve tried for prose uses a frakenmerge (frostmaid) of noromaid  7b
          and a medical 7b mistral model to tally to 10.7b thrown together with frostwind.
          Unfortunately it''s incoherent, moreso than any base model of solar. Frakenmerge
          kills the smarts. It needs like a gradient merge with some smarter models
          mythomax style, but the author hasn''t shared the full model. </p>

          <p>In any case, that brings me to a relevant point - trying to get some
          medical data in there, could be a good start for better prose? I''m not
          even sure why that tends to improve prose but it does. </p>

          <p>Have to agree on this. This model has potential. Would love a v2 that
          fixes these issues. I want to love the model since it is a good model, but
          it just needs some tweaking. Pretty good model otherwise!</p>
