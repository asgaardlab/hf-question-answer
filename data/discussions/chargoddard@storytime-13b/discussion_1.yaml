        html: '<p>I''ve done a lot of chats using a lot of NSFW models like Mythomax,
          Spicyboros, Chronos Hermes, Nous Hermes, Unholy, MLewd, MLewdBoros, UndiMix,
          Pygmalion 6B and 13B as well as the 13B V2 and many many more. But.... in
          my honest opinion, this might be the best model i have seen for roleplay.
          The characters all understand the context, can talk like how they are supposed
          to based on their character card and it almost never gets hallucinations
          or gets out of track with the roleplay. This is so far my favorite model
          right now and i have been using it constantly and it never disappoints for
          me. I would definitely recommend this model.</p>
