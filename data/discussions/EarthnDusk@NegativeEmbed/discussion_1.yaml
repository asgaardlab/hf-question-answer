          issues I want to solve with a lora of mine, among a couple other problems
          I find in various other models and Loras.</p>

          <p>I found this embed through the negative embedding image dataset from
          your account here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Duskfallcrew/Negative_Images">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Duskfallcrew/Negative_Images</a><br>Most
          of those images seem the haven''t been processed for training yet and so
          are lacking captions and that sort of thing.  According to huggingface this
          negative embed used those images for training, so I am curious what steps
          you made for processing the images.</p>

          <p>Furthermore, what settings were used for training is something I can''t
          quite figure out on my own.</p>

          <p>Would you be willing to share some insights into your process for me?  I
          just can''t seem to get a good embedding that does what it''s supposed to,
          for the most part, so I would certainly appreciate your thoughts (and maybe
          a portion of the processed images with their caption files if that isn''t
          too much to ask)</p>
