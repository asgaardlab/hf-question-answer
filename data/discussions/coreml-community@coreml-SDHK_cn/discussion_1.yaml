        html: '<p>The contrast in the first sample image between the illustrated character
          and the photo-realistic background is remarkable. It feels like the model

          write about using a different weight emphasis between the center and the
          periphery of an image.  Maybe that is how this model works?  Favor weights
          from illustrations for the center and weights from photographs for the edges?  It
