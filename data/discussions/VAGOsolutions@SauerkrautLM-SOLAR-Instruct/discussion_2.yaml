        html: "<p>Hello Olofp,<br>thank you very much for your feedback, we appreciate\
          \ it.<br>So generally you can say that data augmentation is one of the most\
          \ important key points. You can use a strong transformer model not just\
          \ to translate from a to b, but also to use augmentation to get similar\
          \ sentences that thematically correspond to the original of the reference\
          \ dataset. This means that many errors that occur during direct translation\
          \ can be avoided in the language to be translated.<br>However, our model\
          \ is still far from perfect. There is always a fine line between a loss\
          \ of performance and good German, which is why the model can sometimes answer\
          \ with poor grammar.<br>The whole thing is currently simply too limited\
          \ by \u201Cpure\u201D fine-tuning.<br>But we are making a big effort to\
          \ improve everything further. We have now at least reached a point where\
          \ we have been able to significantly improve the German of the original\
          \ model and still retain the skills of the original language (in Solar's\
