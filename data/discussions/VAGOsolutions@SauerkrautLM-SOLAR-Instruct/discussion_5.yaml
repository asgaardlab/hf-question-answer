        html: '<p>Hey there,<br>thanks for your great work offering models that work
          well in German.</p>

          <p>I noticed that this model has a non-commercial license while your other
          models have the apache-2.0 licenses. Is that a general shift in your approach
          that will be reflected in future models? Is it just this one? Or are there
          any plans to change this models license in the future?</p>

          <p>Cheers</p>

          <p>thanks for your feedback. Appreciate it. In general, we try to publish
          all our models for commercial use. However, in this case, the SOLAR model,
          provided by Upstage, uses a non-commercial license, which we need to respect.
