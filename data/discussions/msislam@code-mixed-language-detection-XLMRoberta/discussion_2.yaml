          <p>For the second question: As I have understood from my output that your
          concern is "calm down" not being predicted as English.<br>From my point
          of view, the reason might be "calm down" is also quite common to be used
          in the Spanish language as well. So, it is possible that the model is considering
          these two tokens as Spanish by considering the context of the whole sequence
          (calm down dices tu nombre). In other words, the model is detecting a "sequence
          of tokens" from one single language (in this case, Spanish) even with tokens
          which are seeming to be from another language (in this case, English) but
          are also commonly used in that single language (Spanish). That''s why if
          you use "calm down" along with some other English tokens, "calm down" will
          be predicted as English, not Spanish.<br>On the other hand, "Hallo, Guten
          Tag" and "how are you?" is not quite common to be used together. To elaborate,
          it is not common to find "Hallo, Guten Tag" in the English language or "how
          are you?" in the German language. That''s why the model was able to distinguish
          them perfectly.</p>

          <p>I hope it helps. Thanks.</p>
