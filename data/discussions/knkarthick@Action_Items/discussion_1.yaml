        html: '<p>Hi Karthick, I wanted to get more context on this model... particularly
          if this is published anywhere... For context, I am looking for a similar
          model that I want to use in one of my research projects. As a result, I
          am looking into more theoretical background of this model... how it was
          trained? if it not published, was it inspired by other publication etc.
          Thanks in advance! -Riyadh</p>
