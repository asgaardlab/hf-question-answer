        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I''d like to ask if anyone really get correct and stable performance
          for almost questions you asked (large local data, tested several times)
          for RAG (Retrieval-augmented generation)?</p>

          <p>In fact, my local data is a text file with around 150k lines in Chinese.<br>I
          used Baichuan2-13b-chat for LLM and bge-large-zh-v1.5 for embedding model.</p>

          <p>However, when I tried to ask questions related to my local data, I got
          the following issues:</p>

          <ol>

          <li><p>Ask the same questions for different times, the answer is not the
          same (for example, information about number values are totally different)</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>Answer is poor compared with the "context" (extracted from similarity
          search), miss a lot of important information. Also, sometimes, information
          is totally wrong.</p>

          </li>

          </ol>

          <p>I mean, the performance is not capable for industry.</p>

          <p>If anyone still can get good performance, please share with me. I''d
          appreciate about your help!</p>
