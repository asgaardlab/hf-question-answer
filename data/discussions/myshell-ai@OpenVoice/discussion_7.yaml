        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>very cool work. The example demos sound very impressive e.g. Elon''s
          voice. I have followed examples in ref [1] and was able to run things with
          no issues. I then attempted to experiment with adding a few reference voices
          e.g. David Attenborough and Morgan Freeman based on samples found here [2]
          and here [3] (&gt;30s high quality audio recordings of their voices). My
          sample code setup below follows ref [1] and generates outputs with no issues.
          However, the output generated does not correspond with references for either
          voice. Are there additional things to consider like length of the reference
          recording, base speaker tts and other params? Or is it something rather
          silly?</p>

          <p>Sample code:<br>reference_speaker = ''OpenVoice/resources/morgan_freeman_example.mp3''<br>target_se,
          audio_name = se_extractor.get_se(reference_speaker, tone_color_converter,
          target_dir=''processed'', vad=True)<br>save_path = f''{output_dir}/output_morgan_freeman.wav''</p>

          <p>text = "Hello, I am Morgan Freeman, and you are inside the Matrix."<br>src_path
          = f''{output_dir}/tmp.wav''<br>base_speaker_tts.tts(text, src_path, speaker=''default'',
          language=''English'', speed=1.0)</p>
