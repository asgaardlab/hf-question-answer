          \ I'm getting a very small summary that doesn't even properly summarizes\
          \ one document. Here's an example of an output:</p>\n<pre><code>A senior\
          \ Russian draft officer and former submarine commander accused by Ukraine\
          \ of deadly strikes on its territory has been shot dead while jogging in\
          \ the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. Stanislav Rzhitsky, 42, was killed\
          \ on Monday by an unidentified gunman during a morning run in a park near\
          \ the Olimp sports centre, local police said. Russian FSB security services\
          \ said on Tuesday that a 64- year-old man was arrested on suspicion of carrying\
          \ out the attack. At the time of his death, Rzhitsky was serving as the\
          \ deputy head of the Krasnodar c ity administration\u2019s mobilisation.\
          \ According to the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant, Rzhitsky was previously\
          \ the commander of the Krasnodar submarine, named after the city, in the\
          \ Russian navy. The Ukrainian army said in a Telegram post on Tuesday that\
          \ Rzhitsky was in command of a submarine that carried out a deadly missile\
          \ attack on the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsi a in July 2022 , killing 23 civilians.\
          \ Rzhitsky\u2019s father told the Baza, a Russian Telegram channel with\
          \ links to the security services, that his son left the military in December\
          \ 2021, before Russia invaded Ukraine. Several close friends of Rzhitsky\
          \ similar ly told the independent Russian station Dozdh that Rzhitsky left\
          \ the army before the war started. Baza further reported that the killer\
          \ could have tracked Rzhitsky\u2019s runs on the Strava app, as he regularly\
          \ followed the same 4- mile route while running. The Ukrainian defence ministry\u2019\
          s main directorate of intelligence, GUR, did not claim responsibility for\
          \ Rzhitsky\u2019s death. But in a cryptic message, GUR shared a series of\
          \ details about the killing, including the time of the attack (6am) and\
          \ the lack of witnes ses because of rain. \u201CDue to heavy rain, the park\
          \ was deserted, so there were no witnesses who could provide details or\
          \ identify the attacker,\u201D the GUR said. In a later statement, the agency\u2019\
          s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, rejected the claim that Ukrainian intelligence\
          \ was behind the killing. \u201CStatements by some media and politicians\
          \ that the GUR has something to do with the death of Stanislav Rzhitsky\
          \ have no basis,\u201D Budanov said. Ukraine typically declines to claim\
          \ responsibility for attacks on Russia or Russian- annexed Crimea, though\
          \ Kyiv officials have frequently celebrated such attacks with cryptic or\
          \ mocking remarks. US intelligence has previously said the Ukrainian government\
          \ authorised last year\u2019s car bomb attack that killed Darya Dugina ,\
          \ the daughter of the prominent Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin. The\
          \ Britis h defence secretary, Ben Wallace, has suggested Ukraine needs to\
          \ put more emphasis on thanking the west for its assistance after Volodymyr\
          \ Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints on Tuesday that his country had not been issued\
          \ a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato. \u201CWhether\
          \ we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,\u201D Wallace\
          \ said at a briefing in the margins of the Nato summit in the Lithuanian\
          \ capital, Vilnius, when asked about the Ukrainian president\u2019s comments\
          \ that it was \u201Cabsurd\u201D for Kyiv to be told it would be welcome\
          \ in the alliance but not given a date or exact conditions. \u201CSometimes\
          \ you are asking countries to give up their own stocks [of weapons],\u201D\
          \ Wallace said. \u201CSometimes you have to persuade lawmakers on the [Capitol]\
          \ Hill in America.\u201D The US national security adviser, Jake Sullivan,\
          \ told a public forum at the summit he believed \u201Cthe American people\
          \ do deserve a degree of gratitude from the United States government for\
          \ their willingness to step up and from the rest of the world as well\u201D\
          \ . He said: \u201CThe United States of America has stepped up to provide\
          \ an enormous amount of capacity to help ensure that Ukraine\u2019s brave\
          \ soldiers have the ammunition, air defence, the infantry, fighting vehicles,\
          \ the mine clearing equipment and so much else to be able to effectively\
          \ defend against Russia\u2019s onslaught and to take territory back as well.\u201D\
          \ Zelenskiy, speaking in Vilnius on Wednesday, said it was \u201Cunderstandable\
          \ that Ukraine cannot join Nato when at war\u201D but it would have been\
          \ ideal if there had been an invitation for Kyiv to join the alliance. He\
          \ welcomed the results of the Nato summit, in particular the recognition\
          \ that Ukraine did not need to follow a membership action plan, as well\
          \ as the positive news on defence packages announced during the summit.\
          \ Wallace revealed at the briefing that he had travelled to Ukraine last\
          \ year to be presented with a shopping list of weapons. \u201CYou know,\
          \ we\u2019re not Amazon,\u201D he said. \u201CI told them that last year,\
          \ when I drove 11 hours to be given a list.\u201D But he said he understood\
          \ Zelenskiy was speaking to his own public and that, despite his complaint\
          \ on Tuesday, the final summit deal was a good one for Ukraine. There was\
          \ an acceptance that \u201CUkraine belongs at Nato\u201D and that amounted\
          \ to an effective invitation for membership once t he conflict had died\
          \ down. Britain, the US and global allies were due to unveil new security\
          \ assurances for Ukraine on Wednesday. A declaration by the G7 industrialised\
          \ countries \u201Cwill set out how allies will support Ukraine over the\
          \ coming years to end the war and deter and respond to any future attack\u201D\
          , a British government statement said. In practice, this would come as bilateral\
          \ agreements with Kyiv on long- term military and financial aid to keep\
          \ Ukraine\u2019s army and economy running. A White House official said the\
          \ US would start such talks with Kyiv soon. Russia, which says Nato\u2019\
          s eastward expansion is an existential threat to its own security, swiftly\
          \ lashed out. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy secretary of Russia\u2019s powerful\
          \ security council and an anti -western hawk, said increased military assistance\
          \ to Ukraine from Nato was bringing a third world war a step closer. Musician\
          \ Alex Yatsun\u2019s house was shelled by Russian forces, but he has focused\
          \ the trauma and apocalyptic feeling into atmospheric tracks that help him\
          \ get \u2018out of reality\u2019 When the Russian invasion of Ukraine began\
          \ in 2022, Alex Yatsun was living just 30km from the Russian border in the\
          \ northernmost part of Kharkiv. \u201CWhen I woke up that day I started\
          \ living in a completely different reality,\u201D he recalls. \u201CThere\
          \ were bombs falling every hour.\u201D - Yatsun\u2019s family evacuated\
          \ but he soon returned north to more dangerous territory to volunteer at\
          \ a medical centre. \u201CBut my house was hit by shelling,\u201D he recalls.\
          \ A photograph on his Instagram shows the aftermath: huge chunks of wall\
          \ blown out, smashed windows, a mangled front door. \u201CThat was the moment\
          \ I decided to move closer to central Ukraine.\u201D Despite the difficult\
          \ and often harrowing backdrop of the last year, the 24- year-old has managed\
          \ to produce a new 21- track compilation album as DJ Sacred, entitled Dungeon\
          \ Rap: the Evolution . It\u2019s a follow -up to 2019\u2019s, Dungeon Rap:\
          \ the Intr oduction . Dungeon rap is a new hybrid style of hip- hop created\
          \ by Yatsun. It merges Memphis rap \u2013 a style of lo -fi atmospheric\
          \ southern hip- hop made popular by the likes of Three Six Mafia in the\
          \ late 80s and early 90s \u2013 and dungeon synth, a sub- genre that blossomed\
          \ in 1990s Scandinavia blending dark ambient and black metal. Yatsun\u2019\
          s compilations feature a variety of his musical aliases, such as DJ Bishop,\
          \ DJ Armok and Pillbox. While other artists also feature as guests, this\
          \ approach allowed him a variety of musical personalities to explore while\
          \ presenting the image of a more engaged and thriving scene around the infant\
          \ genre. \u201CI came to the conclusion it would be very difficult to develop\
          \ a whole new genre of music only by using one name,\u201D he says. \u201C\
          I thought I could reinvent the process by having these different approaches.\
          \ DJ Armok is more reliant on bass and more heavily connected to Memphis\
          \ rap, whereas Pillbox is more about the ethereal and transcendental \u2013\
          \ like a sublime melancholic feeling.\u201D The res ult is moody and atmospheric\
          \ stuff. Synths hum doomily, lo- fi beats crackle and snap, while sampled\
          \ vocals are often slowed to a woozy drawl, blending in as texture rather\
          \ than leading the charge. Yatsun became so obsessed with Memphis rap, and\
          \ its \u201Cevil\u201D sound, that he spent months breaking down hundreds\
          \ of tracks, collecting their beats, vocals, melodies and synth lines. He\u2019\
          s assembled them in mega packs, containing thousands of samples, that can\
          \ be used as the basis for other people to make their own mut ated twist\
          \ on the genre. There is also a feeling of inescapable darkness to the music.\
          \ Elements of dread hover like ominous clouds about to unleas h a storm\
          \ \u2013 but the storm itself never comes. \u201CThe whole idea of this\
          \ music is the end of times,\u201D Yatsun says. \u201CIt corresponds to\
          \ my life and my beliefs that the future is bleak.\u201D Yatsun also cites\
          \ the late theorist and music critic Mark Fisher, and his writings on hauntology,\
          \ as being linked to the work. \u201CIt relates to the idea of a lost future,\u201D\
          \ he says. \u201CSince the 2013 uprising, most of my life I\u2019ve been\
          \ living in a condition without stability or any clear vision of a future.\
          \ I can\u2019t predict my future be cause I don\u2019t even believe in the\
          \ idea of one, because right now it\u2019s being cancelled. Through this\
          \ music I have nostalgia for times I have never experienced. It\u2019s completely\
          \ out of reality \u2013 more like a fantasy.\u201D Yatsun\u2019s approach\
          \ to creating a new genre out of thin air seemingly worked. There are now\
          \ dungeon rap artists and labels popping up in other countries like Finland,\
          \ Germany and the UK. Some of these new artists embracing the genre \u2013\
          \ like DJ Gravelord, Dominus Soul and Lord Crucifix \u2013 feature as gu\
          \ ests on the latest compilation. Yatsun suggests that the themes of alienation\
          \ and a sense of being trapped in a futureless existence are resonating.\
          \ \u201CIt\u2019s not something that is just localised in Ukraine,\u201D\
          \ he says. \u201CIt\u2019s something we are all experiencing, especially\
          \ the younger generation. It\u2019s now much clearer that what we were promised,\
          \ in terms of neoliberalism and a better life and future, has all started\
          \ to decay. We are all feeling this.\u201D There\u2019s perhaps also an\
          \ element of relating to a deeper darkness at the core of the music that\
          \ is as universally personal as it is political. \u201CIf you look at my\
          \ most popular tracks, most of them were written during very difficult times\
          \ for me,\u201D Yatsun says. \u201CI often have strong, negative emotions\
          \ in myself and I\u2019m tryi ng to battle through them by making art. Hence\
          \ why my music is pretty depressing sometimes.\u201D However, what was pretty\
          \ much an isolated incident of a teenager experimenting with different sounds\
          \ to create a new hybrid genre has steadily bloomed into a conne cted network\
          \ that now spans continents. \u201CDungeon rap is my brainchild,\u201D he\
          \ says. \u201CThe Introduction release was like looking at my child taking\
          \ its first steps. For this one, it\u2019s like looking at my child growing\
          \ up and learning to speak.\u201D\n[{'generated_text': '\u2013 A senior\

          \ he said. \u201CI told them that last year, when I drove 11 hours to be\
          \ given a list.\u201D But he said he understood Zelenskiy was speaking to\
          \ his own public and that, despite his complaint on Tuesday, the final summit\
          \ deal was a good one for Ukraine. There was an acceptance that \u201CUkraine\
          \ belongs at Nato\u201D and that amounted to an effective invitation for\
          \ membership once t he conflict had died down. Britain, the US and global\
          \ allies were due to unveil new security assurances for Ukraine on Wednesday.\
          \ A declaration by the G7 industrialised countries \u201Cwill set out how\
          \ allies will support Ukraine over the coming years to end the war and deter\
          \ and respond to any future attack\u201D, a British government statement\
          \ said. In practice, this would come as bilateral agreements with Kyiv on\
          \ long- term military and financial aid to keep Ukraine\u2019s army and\
          \ economy running. A White House official said the US would start such talks\
          \ with Kyiv soon. Russia, which says Nato\u2019s eastward expansion is an\
          \ existential threat to its own security, swiftly lashed out. Dmitry Medvedev,\
          \ the deputy secretary of Russia\u2019s powerful security council and an\
          \ anti -western hawk, said increased military assistance to Ukraine from\
          \ Nato was bringing a third world war a step closer. Musician Alex Yatsun\u2019\
          s house was shelled by Russian forces, but he has focused the trauma and\
          \ apocalyptic feeling into atmospheric tracks that help him get \u2018out\
          \ of reality\u2019 When the Russian invasion of Ukraine began in 2022, Alex\
          \ Yatsun was living just 30km from the Russian border in the northernmost\
          \ part of Kharkiv. \u201CWhen I woke up that day I started living in a completely\
          \ different reality,\u201D he recalls. \u201CThere were bombs falling every\
          \ hour.\u201D - Yatsun\u2019s family evacuated but he soon returned north\
          \ to more dangerous territory to volunteer at a medical centre. \u201CBut\
          \ my house was hit by shelling,\u201D he recalls. A photograph on his Instagram\
          \ shows the aftermath: huge chunks of wall blown out, smashed windows, a\
          \ mangled front door. \u201CThat was the moment I decided to move closer\
          \ to central Ukraine.\u201D Despite the difficult and often harrowing backdrop\
          \ of the last year, the 24- year-old has managed to produce a new 21- track\
          \ compilation album as DJ Sacred, entitled Dungeon Rap: the Evolution .\
          \ It\u2019s a follow -up to 2019\u2019s, Dungeon Rap: the Intr oduction\
          \ . Dungeon rap is a new hybrid style of hip- hop created by Yatsun. It\
          \ merges Memphis rap \u2013 a style of lo -fi atmospheric southern hip-\
          \ hop made popular by the likes of Three Six Mafia in the late 80s and early\
          \ 90s \u2013 and dungeon synth, a sub- genre that blossomed in 1990s Scandinavia\
          \ blending dark ambient and black metal. Yatsun\u2019s compilations feature\
          \ a variety of his musical aliases, such as DJ Bishop, DJ Armok and Pillbox.\
          \ While other artists also feature as guests, this approach allowed him\
          \ a variety of musical personalities to explore while presenting the image\
          \ of a more engaged and thriving scene around the infant genre. \u201CI\
          \ came to the conclusion it would be very difficult to develop a whole new\
          \ genre of music only by using one name,\u201D he says. \u201CI thought\
          \ I could reinvent the process by having these different approaches. DJ\
          \ Armok is more reliant on bass and more heavily connected to Memphis rap,\
          \ whereas Pillbox is more about the ethereal and transcendental \u2013 like\
          \ a sublime melancholic feeling.\u201D The res ult is moody and atmospheric\
          \ stuff. Synths hum doomily, lo- fi beats crackle and snap, while sampled\
          \ vocals are often slowed to a woozy drawl, blending in as texture rather\
          \ than leading the charge. Yatsun became so obsessed with Memphis rap, and\
          \ its \u201Cevil\u201D sound, that he spent months breaking down hundreds\
          \ of tracks, collecting their beats, vocals, melodies and synth lines. He\u2019\
          s assembled them in mega packs, containing thousands of samples, that can\
          \ be used as the basis for other people to make their own mut ated twist\
          \ on the genre. There is also a feeling of inescapable darkness to the music.\
          \ Elements of dread hover like ominous clouds about to unleas h a storm\
          \ \u2013 but the storm itself never comes. \u201CThe whole idea of this\
          \ music is the end of times,\u201D Yatsun says. \u201CIt corresponds to\
          \ my life and my beliefs that the future is bleak.\u201D Yatsun also cites\
          \ the late theorist and music critic Mark Fisher, and his writings on hauntology,\
          \ as being linked to the work. \u201CIt relates to the idea of a lost future,\u201D\
          \ he says. \u201CSince the 2013 uprising, most of my life I\u2019ve been\
          \ living in a condition without stability or any clear vision of a future.\
          \ I can\u2019t predict my future be cause I don\u2019t even believe in the\
          \ idea of one, because right now it\u2019s being cancelled. Through this\
          \ music I have nostalgia for times I have never experienced. It\u2019s completely\
          \ out of reality \u2013 more like a fantasy.\u201D Yatsun\u2019s approach\
          \ to creating a new genre out of thin air seemingly worked. There are now\
          \ dungeon rap artists and labels popping up in other countries like Finland,\
          \ Germany and the UK. Some of these new artists embracing the genre \u2013\
          \ like DJ Gravelord, Dominus Soul and Lord Crucifix \u2013 feature as gu\
          \ ests on the latest compilation. Yatsun suggests that the themes of alienation\
          \ and a sense of being trapped in a futureless existence are resonating.\
          \ \u201CIt\u2019s not something that is just localised in Ukraine,\u201D\
          \ he says. \u201CIt\u2019s something we are all experiencing, especially\
          \ the younger generation. It\u2019s now much clearer that what we were promised,\
          \ in terms of neoliberalism and a better life and future, has all started\
          \ to decay. We are all feeling this.\u201D There\u2019s perhaps also an\
          \ element of relating to a deeper darkness at the core of the music that\
          \ is as universally personal as it is political. \u201CIf you look at my\
          \ most popular tracks, most of them were written during very difficult times\
          \ for me,\u201D Yatsun says. \u201CI often have strong, negative emotions\
          \ in myself and I\u2019m tryi ng to battle through them by making art. Hence\
          \ why my music is pretty depressing sometimes.\u201D However, what was pretty\

          \ that now spans continents. \u201CDungeon rap is my brainchild,\u201D he\
          \ says. \u201CThe Introduction release was like looking at my child taking\

    \n\r\nprint(result)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I'm doing wrong as I'm getting\
    \ a very small summary that doesn't even properly summarizes one document. Here's\
    \ an example of an output:\r\n\r\n```\r\nA senior Russian draft officer and former\
    \ submarine commander accused by Ukraine of deadly strikes on its territory has\
    \ been shot dead while jogging in the southern Russian city of Krasnodar. Stanislav\
    \ Rzhitsky, 42, was killed on Monday by an unidentified gunman during a morning\
    \ run in a park near the Olimp sports centre, local police said. Russian FSB security\
    \ services said on Tuesday that a 64- year-old man was arrested on suspicion of\
    \ carrying out the attack. At the time of his death, Rzhitsky was serving as the\
    \ deputy head of the Krasnodar c ity administration\u2019s mobilisation. According\
    \ to the Russian daily newspaper Kommersant, Rzhitsky was previously the commander\
    \ of the Krasnodar submarine, named after the city, in the Russian navy. The Ukrainian\
    \ army said in a Telegram post on Tuesday that Rzhitsky was in command of a submarine\
    \ that carried out a deadly missile attack on the Ukrainian city of Vinnytsi a\
    \ in July 2022 , killing 23 civilians. Rzhitsky\u2019s father told the Baza, a\
    \ Russian Telegram channel with links to the security services, that his son left\
    \ the military in December 2021, before Russia invaded Ukraine. Several close\
    \ friends of Rzhitsky similar ly told the independent Russian station Dozdh that\
    \ Rzhitsky left the army before the war started. Baza further reported that the\
    \ killer could have tracked Rzhitsky\u2019s runs on the Strava app, as he regularly\
    \ followed the same 4- mile route while running. The Ukrainian defence ministry\u2019\
    s main directorate of intelligence, GUR, did not claim responsibility for Rzhitsky\u2019\
    s death. But in a cryptic message, GUR shared a series of details about the killing,\
    \ including the time of the attack (6am) and the lack of witnes ses because of\
    \ rain. \u201CDue to heavy rain, the park was deserted, so there were no witnesses\
    \ who could provide details or identify the attacker,\u201D the GUR said. In a\
    \ later statement, the agency\u2019s chief, Kyrylo Budanov, rejected the claim\
    \ that Ukrainian intelligence was behind the killing. \u201CStatements by some\
    \ media and politicians that the GUR has something to do with the death of Stanislav\
    \ Rzhitsky have no basis,\u201D Budanov said. Ukraine typically declines to claim\
    \ responsibility for attacks on Russia or Russian- annexed Crimea, though Kyiv\
    \ officials have frequently celebrated such attacks with cryptic or mocking remarks.\
    \ US intelligence has previously said the Ukrainian government authorised last\
    \ year\u2019s car bomb attack that killed Darya Dugina , the daughter of the prominent\
    \ Russian nationalist Alexander Dugin. The Britis h defence secretary, Ben Wallace,\
    \ has suggested Ukraine needs to put more emphasis on thanking the west for its\
    \ assistance after Volodymyr Zelenskiy\u2019s complaints on Tuesday that his country\
    \ had not been issued a firm timetable or set of conditions for joining Nato.\
    \ \u201CWhether we like it or not, people want to see a bit of gratitude,\u201D\
    \ Wallace said at a briefing in the margins of the Nato summit in the Lithuanian\
    \ capital, Vilnius, when asked about the Ukrainian president\u2019s comments that\
    \ it was \u201Cabsurd\u201D for Kyiv to be told it would be welcome in the alliance\
    \ but not given a date or exact conditions. \u201CSometimes you are asking countries\
    \ to give up their own stocks [of weapons],\u201D Wallace said. \u201CSometimes\
    \ you have to persuade lawmakers on the [Capitol] Hill in America.\u201D The US\
    \ national security adviser, Jake Sullivan, told a public forum at the summit\
    \ he believed \u201Cthe American people do deserve a degree of gratitude from\
    \ the United States government for their willingness to step up and from the rest\
    \ of the world as well\u201D . He said: \u201CThe United States of America has\
    \ stepped up to provide an enormous amount of capacity to help ensure that Ukraine\u2019\
    s brave soldiers have the ammunition, air defence, the infantry, fighting vehicles,\
    \ the mine clearing equipment and so much else to be able to effectively defend\
    \ against Russia\u2019s onslaught and to take territory back as well.\u201D Zelenskiy,\
    \ speaking in Vilnius on Wednesday, said it was \u201Cunderstandable that Ukraine\
    \ cannot join Nato when at war\u201D but it would have been ideal if there had\
    \ been an invitation for Kyiv to join the alliance. He welcomed the results of\
    \ the Nato summit, in particular the recognition that Ukraine did not need to\
    \ follow a membership action plan, as well as the positive news on defence packages\
    \ announced during the summit. Wallace revealed at the briefing that he had travelled\
    \ to Ukraine last year to be presented with a shopping list of weapons. \u201C\
    You know, we\u2019re not Amazon,\u201D he said. \u201CI told them that last year,\
    \ when I drove 11 hours to be given a list.\u201D But he said he understood Zelenskiy\
    \ was speaking to his own public and that, despite his complaint on Tuesday, the\
    \ final summit deal was a good one for Ukraine. There was an acceptance that \u201C\
    Ukraine belongs at Nato\u201D and that amounted to an effective invitation for\
    \ membership once t he conflict had died down. Britain, the US and global allies\
    \ were due to unveil new security assurances for Ukraine on Wednesday. A declaration\
    \ by the G7 industrialised countries \u201Cwill set out how allies will support\
    \ Ukraine over the coming years to end the war and deter and respond to any future\
    \ attack\u201D, a British government statement said. In practice, this would come\
    \ as bilateral agreements with Kyiv on long- term military and financial aid to\
    \ keep Ukraine\u2019s army and economy running. A White House official said the\
