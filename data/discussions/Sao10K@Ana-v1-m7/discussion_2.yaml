          <p>But I still feel like this model is more rich and feels more natural:<br><a

          <li>I no longer able to find the Ashh novel dataset which probably would
          improve Ana more than previously mentioned LimaRP dataset itself.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>I''m just having a feeling that if you merged dolphin-2.2.1-AshhLimaRP-Mistral-7B-GGUF
          on top of Ana-v1-m7<br>and made it with work with Alpaca prompt template
          just like Ana is right now. Ana would be such a good model.</p>
