        html: '<p>This is one of if not the best 13B model that I tested and I''ve
          tested a lot. I have compared it with ChatGPT 3.5 and in some cases its
          answers are better.<br>The main advantages: realy detailed answers and it
          continues to provide text that is on topic without much repetion although
          it has answered already the question.  I wonder if it can be updated with
          Mistral or at least with Undi95/llama2-to-mistral-instruct-diff.<br>Kudos
          to you! Keep up the good work!</p>
