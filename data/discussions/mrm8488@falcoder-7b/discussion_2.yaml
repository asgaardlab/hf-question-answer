        html: '<p>Thanks for the model!</p>

          <p>I am having some trouble figuring out how EOS is supposed to work here,
          neither token_id=2 nor token_id=11 seem to work.  When I try to use the
          GenerationConfig class to load the <code>generation_config.json</code> from
          this model as per the model card it complains that <code>pad_token_id</code>
          isn''t set.</p>

          <p>Has anyone got this model to properly output a single function/class
          at a time and then emit some kind of EOS?</p>
