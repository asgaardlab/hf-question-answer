        html: '<p>Hi. Just checking if this model should work with Easy Diffusion
          v2.5.35 (if you know)? I''ve copied the checkpoint file into the models
          folder for easy diffusion / stable diffusion UI, and I can select it in
          the UI, but it doesn''t seem to take effect (I''ve tested with your example
          prompts too). Any thoughts? Thanks!</p>
