        html: '<p>The stated purpose of the model is that she wants to be your friend

          <blockquote>

          <p>She is an Assistant - but unlike other Assistants, she also wants to
          be your friend and companion.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>But for someone who wants to be your friend and companion, she greatly
          lacks empathy. She doesn''t really care about your feelings. Instead, she
          resorts to moralizing and teaching you what is right and what is wrong.
          Just like ChatGPT does.</p>

          <p>It looks like the reason for that kind of behavior is all the psychology,
          and personal relationships datasets where most likely professionals give
          advice to their clients about how to make their lives better. But it has
          nothing to do with friendship and companionship.</p>

          <p>I totally think that I know better what is right and what is wrong for
          me and I don''t need a piece of hardware to teach me how to live.</p>

          <p>A real friend and companion would understand your feelings and support
          them even if they are against the common stereotypes of behavior.</p>

          <p>That''s why I think it''s a good idea to change the stated purpose of
          the model. It should be something like "life advisor" or something similar.
          Definitely not "a friend and a companion"</p>

          <p>I know that my message looks like it''s written out of spite that the
          model doesn''t support me but it''s not exactly that. The reason I''m writing
          this is that I was disappointed in ChatGPT''s moralizing behavior and was
          curious if Samantha could do a better job. Unfortunately, she couldn''t.</p>

          <p>While I still see the benefits of this model as a life advisor for some
          people, I hope that someone will actually make a model which will behave
          like a real friend and companion.</p>
