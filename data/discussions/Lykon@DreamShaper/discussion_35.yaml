          <p>Thank you for sharing the amazing model. I tested your model in Leonardo.ai
          to do image-to-image generation, and the results were excellent.<br>However,
          when I want to use Diffuser with the DreamShaper v5 to generate the same
          output with the same prompts, input image, and other settings (seeds, steps
          ), the image quality worsens. I know Leonardo.ai uses its own Leonardo sampler,
          so the output may differ. However, there''s a noticeable gap between them
          which makes me confused. I''m using Tesla M60 with a 16G GPU to do the generation.<br>Do
          you know what are the possibilities that make the changes? Thank you very
          much!</p>
