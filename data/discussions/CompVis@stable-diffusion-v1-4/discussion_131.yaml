          why i''m just throwing this out there. (edit: i don''t really understand
          this all the way but i think i figured this out if you''re still struggling:
          the model i had told dreambooth to use didn''t have a model index file for
          dreambooth to do whatever the heck with. i used one from hugging face and
          in the files tab i found one that HAD model_index.json) btw, i have no idea
          if that''s correct, but that''s what worked</p>
