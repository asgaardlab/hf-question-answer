    Where do I put it? (I''m new) Do y''all run it locally or smth?'

          1. Did it take 4 minutes for a simple prompt (under 75 tokens) 512x512 no
          embeddings/loras/controlnet etc?

          2. So even though these settings make it run on CPU''s other than NVIDIA...
          it unfortunately costs longer wait times.

          False


          --skip-cuda-torch-test only SKIPS the test for CUDA

          in other words, it is needed to make the frontend run on AMD.


          If it STILL runs on CPU, then your drivers / something else is incorrectly
          setup and the backend automatically swaps to using CPU.


          The error itself, title of the thread, is INDEPENDENT from whether running
          on CPU or GPU, if the command isn''t supported, this error happens.

          e.g. some models like for example SD 2.1 require --precision full + --no-half
          to force FULL mode (full precision, meaning 32bit i believe)

          because half precision isn''t supported in that model and results in black
          output images...


          Same thing, certain GPUs don''t support either 16bit or 32bit correctly
          in the way that is needed by something in these Diffuser pipelines.


          I hope this information helps, those were good questions.


          when you said:

          Even though it ran on that CPU, it did take like 4 minutes to load a single
          txt2img...

          did you mean:

          Even though it ran on that *GPU*, it did take like 4 minutes to load a single
          txt2img...

          ?


          I don''t expect an 8gb GPU to generate pictures very quickly at all.


          Instead of using --lowvram, try the new optimization parameter --opt-sdp-attention
          and don''t go over 512 when testing.


          Lowvram makes generation slower, to make it use less VRAM.

          Using the new optimization will also make it use less VRAM.


          try --medvram too.


          There''s a way to check if torch(cuda) picks up your GPU outside of the
          UI stuff (on the commandline/terminal) but I forgot how.'

    1. Did it take 4 minutes for a simple prompt (under 75 tokens) 512x512 no embeddings/loras/controlnet
    etc?

    2. So even though these settings make it run on CPU''s other than NVIDIA... it
    unfortunately costs longer wait times.

    False


    --skip-cuda-torch-test only SKIPS the test for CUDA

    in other words, it is needed to make the frontend run on AMD.


    If it STILL runs on CPU, then your drivers / something else is incorrectly setup
    and the backend automatically swaps to using CPU.
