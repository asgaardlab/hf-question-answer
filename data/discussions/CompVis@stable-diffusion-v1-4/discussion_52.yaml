        html: '<p>To allow for changing the image size and still getting similar images,
          it would be an interesting idea to copy the initialization from a smaller
          image to a larger when re-rendering to get similar results in the area where
          the noise was copied. One could also try to scale the noise, but I wonder
          if this would result in blocky images.</p>

          <p>Another idea for brainstorming would be to distribute the noise using
          a space filling curve, starting with the noise from the smaller image and
          then adding new noise afterward.</p>
