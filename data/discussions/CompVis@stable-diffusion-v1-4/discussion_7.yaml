          <p>how this community is helpful. They take for granted you''re a programmer
          who wants to tackle every issue by yourself (which I did, AND THERE WERE
          MANY UNDOCUMENTED ERRORS IN THE SETUP PROCESS, but apparently they are even
          more angry at the fact that I am technical savvy and can solve it by myself
          but still ask for clear documentation), and that you are able to setup everything
          as it''s an easy task.</p>

          <p>What''s your problem exactly? I can help you</p>
