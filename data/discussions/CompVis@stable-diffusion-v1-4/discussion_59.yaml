        html: '<p>Hopefully there is someone  creating a prompt menu with a dropdown
          list and sub dropdowns list to work off of.</p>

          <p>Such as Example:</p>

          <p>These will be all drop down menus with several options to select from</p>

          <p>Type = Game Design<br>Art Style = Concept<br>Artist (Choose up to Three)
          =<br>Games to Reference From (Choose up to Three) = World of Warcraft, Ultima
          Online<br>Quality = 8k<br>Profile (Choose up to Three) = Detailed, Intricate</p>

          <p>This would be a helpful tool for several reasons but the main is so the
          algorithm is capable of narrowing down an exact match better by separating
          the prompt in sections of accuracy and the words don''t get mixed into the
          image the wrong way.   Also make a way so people can add to these list in
          there specialized field.  </p>
