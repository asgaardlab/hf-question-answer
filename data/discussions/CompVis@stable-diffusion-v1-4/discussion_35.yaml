        html: '<p>Ahoy Patrick! Thanks so much for your response. Managed to get it
          going by first of all updating my MacOS (Apple Silicone) and then using
          anaconda and rust. I tried to reproduce what I generated on the DreamStudio
          beta website (using same seed etc) but the results are nowhere near it.
          What ckpt and what py script is the web version using? I used the dream.py
          with the latest v1.4 chkpt as model and also tried the original text2img.py
          but neither were any good. Would be great to know your thoughts on this.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!<br>Phil</p>
