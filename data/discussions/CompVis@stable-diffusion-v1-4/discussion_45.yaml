        html: '<p>I got everything setup on my machine now and tried to reproduce
          what I generated on the DreamStudio beta website (using same seed etc) but
          the results are nowhere near it. What ckpt and what py script is the web
          version using? Does anyone know? </p>

          <p>I used the dream.py with the latest v1.4 chkpt as model and also tried
          the original text2img.py, but neither were any good. Would be great if someone
          had any insight on this.</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!<br>Phil</p>
