        html: '<p>Dear Authors,</p>

          <p>I tried the model to generate sequences for some random Brenda enzymes.
          Many generated sequences are over 90% similar to sequences in Brenda, and
          some are 100% identical. I just want to know if this is expected. I used
          the parameters (top_p, top_k, temperature) recommended in your manuscript.</p>

        html: '<p>Hi Shangao,</p>

          <p>It is only expected in BRENDA classes with high redundancy. For example,
          if a Brenda class only contains 10 sequences, but they are in 10 different
          clusters at 50%, ZymCTRL will generate sequences at that distance. To decrease
          the identity, you could fine-tune the model in a less redundant dataset.<br>Best
          wishes<br>Noelia</p>
