        html: '<p>Dear Authors,</p>

          <p>Thank you for the excellent work with ZymCTRL. I''m trying to fine-tune
          the model so that it generates homologous sequences of a target sequence.
          However, the target sequence is an orphan sequence, and only a dozen high-identity
          sequences can be used as dataset for fine-tuning. Is it possible to fine
          tune the model with this dataset? If yes, then could you please guide with
          how to implement this?</p>

          <p>Thank you so much!</p>

        html: '<p>hi rqh,</p>

          <p>You can fine-tune your dataset with the info in the documentation. There''s
          no rule of thumb for how many sequences are the minimum, although it would
          be good to have at least 100. I''d still suggest you give it a try even
          if you only have, let''s say, 20. One thing you can do is to fine-tune each
          sequence and its reverse.</p>

          <p>Hope this helps!<br>noelia</p>
