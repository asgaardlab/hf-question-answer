        html: '<p>It''s because of how the HF download counter works. It''s never

          <p>I don''t know the exact logic it uses but it definitely seems to require
          a config.json to be present as a minimum - possibly it won''t detect it
          as a model without that, or something like that.  </p>

          <p>I''d forgotten to add <code>config.json</code> for this repo - which
          will be used by the ctransformers library to work out the model type.  That
          might enable the download counter to work now; we''ll see.</p>
