  content: "> Yeah I know that this repo uses the same dataset as Anon.\n> \n> I was\
    \ asking which dataset AlekseyKorshuk used to produce his 7B version.  It's not\
    \ a big deal, I'm just trying to understand whether Aleksey's is a 7B equivalent\
    \ of this 13B, or if they also differ in dataset used.\n\noh my bad I misread\
    \ your message.\n\nAleksey said he used anon's set 5 days ago, so it was likely\
    \ an older version than the \"i'm sorry\" dataset that reeducator used.\nhttps://huggingface.co/AlekseyKorshuk/vicuna-7b/discussions/4#64346742938d07505bb8e01b\n\
    \nhis model is 10 days old so maybe he used the dataset in `HTML_cleaned_raw_dataset`?"
