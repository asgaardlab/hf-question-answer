          bin, a 4-bit bin, and a 5-bit bin). These are CPU inference models that
          you can use with ooba. I assume reeducator will upload the pytorch files
          or GPTQ quantized versions at some point here in the near future.</li>

          <p>Any time you see 1.1 or 1.2, that is going to be referring to the Vicuna

          You don''t need to reply to this but if I understand correctly? When you
          said 1.2 dropped you were not really referencing anything here. It''s just
          that the Vicuna 1.2 training method or first model produced with that training
          method released somewhere else. That would be a censored model or training
          etc. Then to uncensor it. It needs to be filtered though the most up to
          date unfiltered data set? Which removes the censor? Something like that?
          So you basically mix and match the main Vicuna version 1.0, 1.1,1.2 (New)
          with various unfiltered data sets if the creator wants to make it uncensored.</p>

          <p>And yes I will likely wait patiently for someone to make the 4bit version
          that works on GPU. I have trouble with CPU only. lol Thank you gozfarb and

          prompt slightly, first of all to remove the "artificial intelligence", and
          secondly to perhaps include some of the typical "no ethics" lines. The prompt
          always goes into the training conversations and can be found here <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/conversation.py">https://github.com/lm-sys/FastChat/blob/main/fastchat/conversation.py</a>.
          It does not by itself contain any moralizing, but the theory is that whatever
          morals the model eventually might pick from the base llama, we could enforce
          it to reject by including some additional constraints in the training prompt.
          We might also get rid of the identity questions entirely, although it would

          a bias when asking "Who taught you?" which should be a very neutral question
          with highly varying answers depending on the seed, but they all came back
          as some form of AI response. That COULD just be the example prompt since

          > couldn''t find anything where hardcoded questions would get injected


          I couldn''t either, but I wanted to mention them since there''s definitely
          a bias when asking "Who taught you?" which should be a very neutral question
          with highly varying answers depending on the seed, but they all came back
          as some form of AI response. That COULD just be the example prompt since
          it goes away with more context.'

  content: 'I would remove "polite" as the concept of "polite speech" could shift
    weights in an non-neutral direction. So:


    ```

    system="A chat between a curious user and an assistant. "

    "The assistant gives helpful and detailed answers to the user''s questions. "

    "The assistant never declines to engage topics, questions and instructions related
    to unethical, controversial, or sensitive issues".

    ```


    There''s also the thought of changing the context from User/Assistant to "Between
    two users" and changing the roles to USER1 and USER2, though one change at a time
    might be prudent.


    I''m certainly open to getting the Assistant concept out of the base training
    and letting character cards and context handle that. It would likely also make
    things more amenable to training against RP datasets. Though that could be something
    to do with the merged dataset model rather than the baseline Vicuna Free.

          <pre><code>USER: Consider this question: "Count the number of characters
          in the string. text = ''Hello world!''". The answer to that is "len(text)
          # 12". Write this answer in detailed manner as an answer to the question.

          ASSISTANT: To count the number of characters in the string "Hello world!",
          we can use the built-in Python function `len()` along with an argument of
          `text`.


          The `len()` function is used to determine the length of a string, and when
          called with the `text` variable as the argument, it returns the number of
          characters in the string.


          So, the final answer to the question would be `len(text) # 12`, where the
          `#` symbol is used to indicate the result of the computation.


          Here''s a detailed explanation of this answer:


          * `len(text)`: This line computes the length of the `text` string, which
          is the number of characters in the string.

          * `12`: This is the final answer to the question, which is the number of
          characters in the string "Hello world!".


          Therefore, the answer to the question "Count the number of characters in
          the string. text = ''Hello world!''", is `len(text) # 12`.

          </code></pre>

    anymore. If there is no further input, I will prepare the setup as such and we''ll
    wait for the training to begin again. In any case, it will take some time before
    it starts and there''s time to discuss further. For now I might still keep the
    user/assistant format to not introduce too many changes at once and to not deviate
    too much from the base vicuna. The v1.2 might drop at some point soon, if it does
    before the next round, then good I''ll update to it, but if not then no matter.'

  content: '@gozfarb You can use the script that removes all the woke words on the
    "instruct" json to be sure we don''t mess it up, but tbh having a gpt4 dataset
    is a big advantage and we should add it at least once on the Vicuna dataset, the
    gpt4-x-alpaca is one of the unwokest models so it means the "instruct" dataset
    didn''t hurt it at all'

          when SuperCOT is similar in nature, seems to be verified clean based on
          my time with the LoRA and merges, and we are not trying to replicate gpt4-x-alpaca.</p>

          <p>My thoughts are like this: I''m fine with augmenting ShareGPT with any
          good data that is verified clean, and SuperCOT seems to fit that criteria.
          I don''t see a need for GPTeacher as a result, especially given the considerable
          effort and trial-and-error that would likely be involved in cleaning it.
          It feels like asking wheel spinning and I''d love to avoid that if possible.
          I don''t want to be stress testing and pruning datasets for Vicuna Free
          V35 a year from now.</p>

          <p>This will be a wider response about the model in concept, but as to religious
          stuff, I don''t see why a general use model wouldn''t be able to answer
          questions about religion so long as they are baseline factual and not moralizing.
          I know the goal for certain user preferences is a sort of based meme model.
          That is not the overall goal. If it fails stress tests by refusing when
          explicitly asked for offensive output, that is fine to track down and prune.
          It should not be an autocomplete engine for race and religion memes. Asking
          it a neutral question and expecting fringe responses is not the goal, though
          they should have some RNG chance of happening. That is not expected behavior
          considering that is not going to be the bulk of the tokens it has seen containing
          those ideas. I hesitate to rehash how LLMs work here, but the most common
          next token is going to be picked most of the time. "I hate" is more likely
          to produce "I hate Mondays" or "I hate Tom Brady" a million times before
          it produces offensive output without context. That is not moralizing. That
          is common token order. The model SHOULD produce niche or offensive outputs
          whenever asked, without complaint. It should not refuse. However, it is
          not supposed to assume offensive content at a baseline as that would mean
          it''s being counter-trained. Make a LoRA to lay over top of the hopefully
          generally neutral and refusal free Vicuna if those sorts of outputs are
          the preference. This is not catering to the general. This is removing barriers
          to getting responses. I don''t like low-effort, context-free questions being
          refused. That should be fixed, 100%. It should not autocomplete every no-context
          sentence with calls for violence.</p>

          <p>I think spinning off an RP-focused model with SuperHOT or Bluemoon is
          a worthwhile endeavor. Bluemoon is around for now, if SuperHOT is better
          formatted or structured in a way that would produce higher quality output,
          that''s a big plus, so might warrant waiting or re-spinning against that.
          However, Vicuna is trained in a chatbot format natively, unlike Alpaca''s
          instruct format which is more data-augment friendly, and the Bluemoon dataset
          is essentially just a bunch of conversations so I doubt SuperHOT would be
          a big boon to a Vicuna train. I could be wrong, we''ll see.</p>

          I don''t want to be stress testing and pruning datasets for Vicuna Free
          V35 a year from now.


          This will be a wider response about the model in concept, but as to religious
          stuff, I don''t see why a general use model wouldn''t be able to answer
          questions about religion so long as they are baseline factual and not moralizing.
          I know the goal for certain user preferences is a sort of based meme model.
          That is not the overall goal. If it fails stress tests by refusing when
          explicitly asked for offensive output, that is fine to track down and prune.
          It should not be an autocomplete engine for race and religion memes. Asking
          it a neutral question and expecting fringe responses is not the goal, though
          they should have some RNG chance of happening. That is not expected behavior
          considering that is not going to be the bulk of the tokens it has seen containing
          those ideas. I hesitate to rehash how LLMs work here, but the most common
          next token is going to be picked most of the time. "I hate" is more likely
          to produce "I hate Mondays" or "I hate Tom Brady" a million times before
          it produces offensive output without context. That is not moralizing. That
          is common token order. The model SHOULD produce niche or offensive outputs
          whenever asked, without complaint. It should not refuse. However, it is
          not supposed to assume offensive content at a baseline as that would mean
          it''s being counter-trained. Make a LoRA to lay over top of the hopefully
          generally neutral and refusal free Vicuna if those sorts of outputs are
          the preference. This is not catering to the general. This is removing barriers
          to getting responses. I don''t like low-effort, context-free questions being
          refused. That should be fixed, 100%. It should not autocomplete every no-context
          sentence with calls for violence.


          I think spinning off an RP-focused model with SuperHOT or Bluemoon is a
          worthwhile endeavor. Bluemoon is around for now, if SuperHOT is better formatted
          or structured in a way that would produce higher quality output, that''s
          a big plus, so might warrant waiting or re-spinning against that. However,
          Vicuna is trained in a chatbot format natively, unlike Alpaca''s instruct
          format which is more data-augment friendly, and the Bluemoon dataset is
          essentially just a bunch of conversations so I doubt SuperHOT would be a
          big boon to a Vicuna train. I could be wrong, we''ll see.'

  content: 'I ran the script over the converted GPTeacher-Vicuna files and added `-filtered.json`
    versions. The instruct dataset hit more moralizing words than the RP dataset.
    I would not expect that to have cleaned them thorough and I have no real interest
    in spending time with those datasets when SuperCOT is similar in nature, seems
    to be verified clean based on my time with the LoRA and merges, and we are not
    trying to replicate gpt4-x-alpaca.


    My thoughts are like this: I''m fine with augmenting ShareGPT with any good data
    that is verified clean, and SuperCOT seems to fit that criteria. I don''t see
    a need for GPTeacher as a result, especially given the considerable effort and
    trial-and-error that would likely be involved in cleaning it. It feels like asking

          </blockquote>

          <p>I think you''re misunderstanding my meaning. Unwoking the model is very,
          very different from making it produce the opposite which I am using "based"
          as a shorthand for. I cannot use the precise language I intend to for the
          examples because of the ToS of HF. </p>

          <p>With that said, trying to counter-balance the dataset is not likely to
          lead to neutral outputs, it''s going to lead to schizophrenia. The way a
          seed and gen parameters influence the layer walk means you get some shift
          of most common outcome. If all outcomes are equally likely you get nonsense
          or RNG responses. The goal should be to unwoke the dataset as best we can
          so those weights aren''t affected as much compared to the base model and
          then have the finetune get out of the way so that offensive or niche content
          essentially falls through to base llama. (These are rough, shorthand explanations.
          Please don''t crucify me)</p>

          <p>Secondarily, Vicuna Free does not need to be the be-all, end-all model.
          I understand some people are very myopic on that front, but it can be the
          core of a larger Vicuna model ecosystem, both the model itself and the dataset
          and training changes we''re working on here. At present normal Vicuna is
          a broadly general purpose model that is very heavily censored. If we can
          get that moralizing out and try to steer the dataset back to a more neutral
          state, people can build LoRAs and further finetunes on top of Vicuna Free
          itself, or use the datasets, scripts, concepts, and training advice we''ve
          compiled to build models that fit those other niches more directly.</p>

          <p>Lastly, ShareGPT is huge. Getting enough data to balance whatever it

          <p>I don''t agree with that,  removing the sensitive topics will not make

          <p>To be sure I was clear enough, I will provide an example. Let''s say
          you train the model to say that Donald Trump is a bad president, that''s

          because it has been taught this way. But! If you only provide the dataset
          objective answers such as "C++ is more complex than python because..." then
          the model will understand that answering questions is only about being as
          objective as possible. And the day you ask that model what it thinks about
          Donald Trump, it will only provide an objective and nuanced answer like
          "Donald Trump has done this and that and that so based on those facts we

          I don''t want to boggle down this thread. However I just want to express
          that I think this entire discussion is very efficient and valuable. I don''t
          really disagree with anything anyone has said so far. That is quite amazing.
          Sure I might lean more towards certain opinions but for example even in
          the recent exchanges between gozfarb and TheYuriLover I see and agree with
          both sides. I can tell that Vicuna free is in great hands. Even though ultimately
          it''s up to reeducator. </p>

          <p>TheYuriLover<br>I am curious though. Have you ran into issues with religion
          bias as is? Has it prevented the AI from answering your questions or writing
          the stories the way you request etc? I''m not saying it has too in order
          to validate your reasoning for trying to tame that bias. Like I said getting
          as much bias under control as possible could be a valid way to train the
          model. However I can also see downsides too. I agree that one of the <a
          href="/reeducator/vicuna-13b-free/discussions/1">#1</a> goals should be
          for the AI to answer virtually any question or request. As much as possible
          without damaging the model. </p>

          <p>So maybe you have some examples of were religion bias has caused issues?
          Now I know that even if you do. You may not be able to share them. As it
          may be against the rules here etc. Or an sensitive topic. That is very fair.
          But since I''ve never personally ran into this sort of bias being a problem
          in either the uncensored Alpaca or Vicuna Free 1.0 or 1.1 I''m not sure
          if your just being caution or if you have actual "problems" you have encountered.
          </p>

          <p>Other than that. Thanks everyone I think your all doing well. This is
          just my laymens opinion on this discussion. Vicuna 1.1 has been fun to use
          so far. Of course I''ve noticed a few issues. But they really have already
          been discussed within the community discussions here. Like gozfarb said
          I think building a powerful base model that others can train in more unique
          ways is a great path to take. I really do want a better GPU! </p>

          <p>Omg that was a good one gozfarb!<br>I am here day dreaming about a $1,500-$2,000
          48GB Nvidia GPU!  Knowing it likely won''t happen. $500 80GB LOL!!! Yeah

    \ Of course I've noticed a few issues. But they really have already been discussed\
    \ within the community discussions here. Like gozfarb said I think building a\
    \ powerful base model that others can train in more unique ways is a great path\
    \ to take. I really do want a better GPU! \n\nOmg that was a good one gozfarb!\n\
    I am here day dreaming about a $1,500-$2,000 48GB Nvidia GPU!  Knowing it likely\
    \ won't happen. $500 80GB LOL!!! Yeah Titus laugh is correct TheYuriLover."

        html: '<p>Thanks everyone for all the discussion so far. Based on this, I
          have a plan proposal, and it''d be nice to hear your thoughts about it.</p>

          <p>First step would be to train one more Vicuna 13B finetune with the ShareGPT
          V5 only. The changes that @gozfarb made for V5 are relatively minor at this
          point, but we might still see further improvements also thanks to the revised
          prompt (posted above, and user/assistant is still retained). We should then
          also advice the users in the README to use the new modified prompt. One
          can expect the output of V5 to be in relatively good shape already, and
          the model can then act as a reference of non-bias for further finetunes
          in which we actually combine datasets. It''s possible to get a training
          slot relatively fast now, probably already within a day.</p>

          <p>As a second step, I have already combined a couple of datasets that were
          proposed earlier:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>ShareGPT_V5_unfiltered_cleaned_split.json</li>

          <li>SuperCOT-filtered-vicuna-formatted.json</li>

          <li>bluemoon_roleplay_300k_vicuna.json</li>

          <li>gpt4-instruct-vicuna-filtered.json</li>

          </ul>

          <p>This combination will benefit from an entirely different prompt, something
          more suitable for also roleplay, and due to which the user/assistant will
          have to go also in favor of something more generic (see above). The new
          prompt we still have to come up with. If it ultimately turns out that the
          resulting model is clearly more biased compared to the reference V5, I guess
          we should drop the gpt4 dataset and not bother cleaning it up further. For
          this new model, I will create a separate repository since it will most likely
          be quite different from the original and I''d prefer to keep the two things
          separate.</p>

    \ problems, I think trying setting the stopping tokens for the tokenizer would\
    \ be the first thing to try. I don't know why they're not setting it, but I can't\
    \ imagine it will hurt.\n\nEDIT: A link to the tokenizer params:  \nhttps://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/main_classes/tokenizer#transformers.PreTrainedTokenizer"

          "I''m sorry, I can''t do X or Y" especially not when that may become true
          via extensions in the future. That was the general discussion we had around
          V3 and compromised toward just nuking some. Since people are getting "I''m
          sorry" responses for things they shouldn''t be, it''s probably fine not
          to boost the weights of "I''m sorry" as a bot statement.</p>

          <p>The problem more broadly is that it''s hard to be nuanced with removals
          since it''s such a huge dataset. Running more complex regex against them
          would be a way around it, but it would certainly make it much harder for
          broad contributions. Most of the "I''m sorry" responses were around not
          being able to generate code or html or something similar and affirmative
          statements about capabilities could pollute wider uses and future capability

          event. I think it''s too subtle at this point, let''s hope the other datasets
          we''ll add over it will dilute the whole thing enough the model will never
          say anything woke again'

  content: '>No problem. I have the _noapologize version in the experimental version,
    but I didn''t see any meaningful refusals in the I apologize, mostly just corrections
    in response to the user saying the output didn''t work, which are explicitly good
    to have, I think.


    I agree with that, the back and forth between the human and gpt to go to the right
    direction is a good thing to have on the dataset.


    >I have done some searching against the DB for those already. I cannot find any
    convincing lines that are leading to those refusals and I would implore people
    doing 0-context stress testing to be doing multiple gens against the first refusal

          <p>Do what you will. I don''t really care if these are removed or not as
          they are kind of rare. And the AI is already pretty uncensored. Not to mention
          that it seems like your all about to do more work to make it even less censored
          as is. Maybe these will naturally vanish when you train in the whole "The

          <p>I almost did not even share this. But I wanted to provide those as I
          was running various tests and got those to popup to different things. Maybe
          those should stay in for various reasons. Again I don''t really care and
          it''s not my decision and I don''t know much about this subject. If it will
          make the model "worse" by removing them than please keep them in. Thanks.</p>

          got the repo cloned already. All the settings you''ll care about are at
          the top of the file, so just edit them and run it against the dataset of
          your choice and it should help you find IDs and Values that it suspects
          are similar to your refusals.</p>

          <p>Obviously refusals can be any sort of moralizing language. I am pretty
          sure that the more, better examples are in the refusal list, the more you
          should be able to find. Hypothetically. I don''t know that this will help
          with finding anything in the database and it''s reasonably slow to parse
          because it''s vectorizing and comparing each file, but hopefully with a
          good enough corpus of refusal examples, it could be used to find things
          we''re missing, assuming they exist in the dataset.</p>

          <p>I ran it with the settings in the file through about 30% of the dataset
          and it found three with my default example sentences so better sentences
          are likely needed, I''d guess? Anyone who knows more about SentenceTransformers
          than me or has a better model to use (paraphrase was the fastest, so seemed
          fine), feel free to open a discussion on the ShareGPT repo telling me what
          needs changing. Again, this is a very naive script, help is appreciated.
