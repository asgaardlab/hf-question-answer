        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Loving PygmalionAI. Super fun to play around with in Python using HuggingFace
          transformers. :)</p>

          <p>I''ve noticed with some of the notebook implementations allow for more
          character persona options, rather than just describing "persona: xyz" and
          passing that as the first part of the input to the HF transformer model.
          Is there a way to use W++ or even a JSON as the "persona" when using PygmalionAI
          / python / HF transformers / AutoModelforCausalLM?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

        html: '<p>At the end of the day, every single notebook/UI that you use eventually
          just generates a glob of text (usually called the "prompt") to send off
          to the model. That means that if you want to use W++ or JSON for the persona,
          all you have to do is dump that into the prompt text. For example, if you
          have a character called Emma you could try a really basic prompt like:</p>

          <pre><code>Emma''s Persona: (your JSON or W++ text here)

          &lt;START&gt;

          (possibly some example dialogue/interactions here in the same format as
          the 2 messages below)

          You: (your message here)

          Emma:
