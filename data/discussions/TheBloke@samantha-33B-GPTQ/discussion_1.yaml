          I had a bunch of problems, and I forgot to update the README. My READMEs
          are automated for GGML now, but not for GPTQ, so there''s still room for
          human error there. But I''m working on the process to automate GPTQs right
          now, so this shouldn''t be an issue much longer.</p>

          <p>The README is now correct.</p>
