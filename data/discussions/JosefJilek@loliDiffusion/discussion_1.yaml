  content: 'Well, luckily i cant mess the process of instalation with my ignorance
    cause my WebUI have a model manager, its basicaly 1click process xD I already
    have lots of models of this site i really dont know why yours is not working...
    Well anyway, seems i have to wait for now or try it on linux maybe. Honestly run
    the Automatic1111 on CPU is not really an option cause of masive time needed but
    i will still trying things like converting the entire directory myself to onnx
    format for this UI or something...


    Thnx for your time and for your york :)'
