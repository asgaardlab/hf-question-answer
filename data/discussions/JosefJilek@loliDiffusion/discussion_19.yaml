        html: '<p>I actually plan to do LoRA (well IA3) releases after there will
          be resolved one issue regarding merging IA3. Uploaded for you one experiment,
          it''s IA3 so you need LyCORIS for it to run, it will perform best on AOM3A3
          and might be usable even some other models but the comaptibility compared
          to standard LoRA will be really low. It will not owerride any model capabilities
          but it''s as the name suggest experimental so expect some issues. I will
          be happy if you could give me some feedback regarding this experiment.<br><a
