          <p>The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an
          81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square,
          measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the
          Eiffel Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made
          structure in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler
          Building in New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure
          to reach a height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial
          at the top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building
          by 5.2 metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second
          tallest free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.</p>

          <p>My question is, why does this xsum-1-1 version even exist, if there''s
          something like the cnn-12-6 available? Is it just available for people who
          haven''t had a chance to "upgrade" yet, or is there a reason people would
