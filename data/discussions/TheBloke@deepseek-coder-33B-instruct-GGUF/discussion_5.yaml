        html: '<p>I''m testing Aider deployment with different models. Aider has its
          own in which it asks the model 134 programming questions and then tests
          the results. From previous tests on different models I know that yes, it
          is normal for the larger model to score better. In case of this model though,
          I''m seeing these scores:</p>

          : 43.3% : 52.2%<br>deepseek-coder-33b-instruct.Q8_0.gguf : 38.8% : 44.8%</p>

          <p>This seems wrong. The Q4_K_S test was run twice on RTX4090 and once on
          M1Max with similar results. The Q8_0 test was run only once on the M1Max.
          I have no idea what is going on here. Could the Q8_0 be bad?</p>

          <p>Both files were downloaded after your (several) fixes.</p>
