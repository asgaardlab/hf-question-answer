        html: '<p>Hi, I would love to train on Dreambooth with this model as the base.</p>

          <p>You mentioned that you merged a trained model with another model for
          illustration. Was that illustration model also released under creativeml-openrail-m
          license?  and also if that illustration model or this model contains any
          other model other than base SD 1.5</p>

          <p>I wanted to see if it is possible to use it for commercial purposes.
          </p>
