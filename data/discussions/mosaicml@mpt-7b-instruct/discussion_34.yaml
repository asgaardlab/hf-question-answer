          \ ! </p>\n<p>i'm looking for some guidance on few shot prompting  with the\
          \ mpt-7b models. is there any specific prompt format your team has found\
          \ works well? Some other models (jurassic 2, etc) do well with few shot\
          \ prompts with each example separated by a special separator token, is there\
          \ any similar separator token here? </p>\n<p>Example: </p>\n<p>do task a\
          \ on input below:<br>input: abcd<br>output: x<br>##<br>do task a on input\
          \ below:<br>input: abcdef<br>output: xyz<br>##<br>do task a on input below:<br>input:\
          \ abcdefghi<br>output:</p>\n<p>Additionally, what do you recommend as far\
          \ as using the base model or instruction tuned model for few shot prompting?\
