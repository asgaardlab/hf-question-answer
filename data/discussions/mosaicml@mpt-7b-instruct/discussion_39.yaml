    labelers tended to add very long context values, likely without knowing this was
    going to be used as prompt+input (like in Alpaca).


    Here''s the dataset and the readme, where we detail some of these aspects: https://huggingface.co/datasets/argilla/databricks-dolly-15k-curated-multilingual


    We have also kept track of the ids and the field values of the original Databricks
    dataset (for provenance and reproducibility)


    Additionally, it contains automatic translations for es, fr, and de, in case it''s
    also useful for you.


    We''d love to hear back from you, respond to any questions about it, or help in
    any way'
