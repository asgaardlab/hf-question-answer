          <p>I have downloaded the repo with git lfs and I am trying to load the model
          from local but I get the error mentioned above. I have a hunch that I should
          change some config somewhere for the pytorch weights to be read in correctly,
          but I''m not sure how. Any help is much appreciated.</p>
