        html: '<p>Hi, indeed I made a mistake while reading the paper (one of several)
          and just fixed it on the readme. Also added some things I''ve noticed since
          (like the fact that the head is not the same and the one I''m using here
          is not ideal). </p>

          <p>We are working to release the inference (already ready internally) and
          training code (need some refactoring) in the following months and I will
          try to fix these mistakes to see if we can get even closer to reproducing
          the numbers. Obviously getting the one from the original authors would be
          better, but I hope that the current version can help you anyway.</p>
