        html: '<p>I have downloaded all the files, including ''modelling_flash_llama.py''
          and I am trying to load this model with autogptq.</p>

          <p>model = AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(subfolder_containing_model,
          ...)</p>

          <p>However, the code is trying to find modelling_flash_llama.py from the
          togethercomputer repo even though I have the file in the local directory.
          Since I have no internet on the pc, I just get an error here "Could not
          locate the modelling_flash_llama.py inside togethercomputer//LLaMA-2-7B-32K".
          Is there any way to work around this?</p>

          <p>Thanks for your help!</p>
