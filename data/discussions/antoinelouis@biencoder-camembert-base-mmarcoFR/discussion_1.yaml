        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>Thank you for your excellent work. I''m trying to run the code to test
          the model. I''m working in an anaconda environment with jupyter. When executing
          the code, I get an error after downloading the model. Here''s an extract:</p>

          <p>RuntimeError: "LayerNormKernelImpl" not implemented for ''Half''</p>

          <p>I confess I don''t see where this could be coming from since I''ve tested
          quite a bit of code from HuggingFace and haven''t had any similar problems.
          So I''m simply asking the question.</p>

          <p>Thanks for your reply.</p>
