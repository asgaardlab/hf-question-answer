        html: '<p>Hello, </p>

          <p>We are trying to experiment on Question Answering in Greek. We are very
          new to all this, as this is not our actual field, so please forgive me if
          I say something totally irrelevant.</p>

          <p>From my understanding what I should do is to run run_squad.py but instead
          of using Squad dataset , I should use a dataset containing greek, such as
          XNLI dataset or the bert-base-greek-uncased-v1 dataset.</p>

          <p>However , the structure of Squad dataset is different in comparison to
          other two and i am confused on this.</p>

          <p>Could you please give some instructions on how , if possible, I could
          use the bert-base-greek-uncased-v1 dataset for Question Answering? Is this
          possible, or a new greek dataset structure must be created? </p>

          <p>Thank you in advance!</p>
