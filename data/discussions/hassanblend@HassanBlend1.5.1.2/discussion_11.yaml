        html: '<p>I have started using  your model as I like the face rendering and
          other bodily accuracy.</p>

          <p>But I have noticed an issue.  These 4 images were created from the prompt
          "A group of service engineers in orange overalls and white hard hats, wearing
          eye protection, standing round a table on which are laid out engineering
          drawings. The background is a large industrial plant"</p>

          <p>Ignoring, for the moment, the absence of a table in three of the four,
          and that bare arms don''t go with overalls, the more concering issue is
          that all of the people portrayed are White.  And Male. </p>

          <p>Now, this may be an artifact of the training set, where the description
          ''service engineer'' is poorly represented.  But that just pushes the problem
          back one place.  People of any skin colour and gender can be service engineers.  We
          must represent that.</p>
