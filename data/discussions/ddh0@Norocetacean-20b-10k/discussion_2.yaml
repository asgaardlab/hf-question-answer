          <p>I am getting the same error still. I am using TheBloke''s AWQ version
          of this model and have seen that the configuration_llama.py rope_scaling
          has changed to None. I tried rope_scaling as None and "yarn" already but
          it still gives me that error. Any ideas on fixes? </p>
