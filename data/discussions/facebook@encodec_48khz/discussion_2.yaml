        html: '<p>Hello, and thank you for sharing the EnCodec model!</p>

          <p>I noticed the model card indicates that this model (the 48kHz stereo
          EnCodec) was trained on speech, music, and general audio data. However,
          the paper (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13438.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2210.13438.pdf</a>)
          indicates that the 48kHz stereo model was only trained on music data:</p>

          <pre><code>4.1: Dataset

          We train EnCodec on 24 kHz monophonic across diverse domains, namely: speech,
          noisy speech, music and

          general audio while we train the fullband stereo EnCodec on only 48 kHz
          music.

          </code></pre>

          <p>It appears the model cards are almost identical between the 24kHz mono
          and 48kHz stereo models - perhaps this difference can be documented here
          for the 48kHz checkpoint, to reduce potential confusion.</p>

          <p>All the best!</p>
