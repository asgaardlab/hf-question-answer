        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>Congratulations on this great success.</p>

          <p>I noticed that in the Model Card it says, "We note that since IDEFICS
          was trained on PMD (which contains COCO), the evaluation numbers on COCO
          are not directly comparable with Flamingo and OpenFlamingo since they did
          not explicitly have this dataset in the training mixture."</p>

          <p>However, as far as I know, datasets like VQAv2 and OKVQA also build on
          images from COCO. Are IDEFICS''s results directly comparable with Flamingo
          and OpenFlamingo on these benchmarks as well?</p>

          <p>Thanks. </p>
