          <p>Some minor flaws regarding coherence here and there, but not more then
          what ChatGPT 3.5 would do, so nothing to worry about. </p>

          <p>When you released MXLewd 20b, it has blown me away in the 16bit version
          on 8k. This is the by far best (lewd) RP Model I have ever tried, ChatGPT
          included!!</p>

          <p>Thank you very much!</p>
