        html: '<p>Hello, I deployed the model in a serverless Sagemaker end point.
          However, I can''t find the documentation on what should i send and in which
          format to the model so i can get an inference. Which data structure? and
          does it make the pre processing in the deployed model? or do i need still
          to load the processors and pre process the image and tex? </p>

          <p>Help will be much appreciated. Thank you!</p>
