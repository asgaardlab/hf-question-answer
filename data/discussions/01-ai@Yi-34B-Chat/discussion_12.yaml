        html: '<p>Hi Yi Team!</p>

          <p>First of all thanks for the great foundational model released.<br>Just
          to give also some deserved information,  Xaberius is powered by it and UNA
          does <strong>NOT</strong> have an SFT phase or any other similar where corpus
          is extended, it can only yeld what''s already inside the model.</p>

          <p>He is the result of merely aligning what''s inside Yi-34B, and it wouldn''t
          be possible without your goliath contribution.</p>

          <p>I come today to highlight 2 existing discussions from the community that
          I believe can be relevant to your team:</p>
