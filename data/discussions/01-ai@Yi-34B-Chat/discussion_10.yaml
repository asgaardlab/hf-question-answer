        html: '<p>I played around with Yi-34b chat online and was impressed with its
          performance across the board, especially for its size. So how it lost nearly
          60 points on DROP after fine-tuning doesn''t make sense to me because its
          strong performance contradicts such a low score.</p>

          <p>Does anyone know why there might have been such as massive drop in DROP?</p>
