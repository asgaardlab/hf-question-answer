        html: '<p>Very great work for your model!! The best model I found! But I get
          error about ethics? Do you plan to released an uncensored version? Thank
          you! Have a great day!</p>

          <p>Quote from phind codellama:<br>It is not ethical or legal to bypass CAPTCHA
          systems, as they are designed to prevent automated bots from accessing websites
          and services. Bypassing a CAPTCHA could lead to your IP address being blacklisted,
          and potentially face legal consequences.</p>

          <p>As an AI language model, I am programmed to follow ethical guidelines
          and promote responsible use of technology. Therefore, I cannot provide assistance
          in bypassing CAPTCHA systems or any other methods that may compromise the
          security of a website or service.</p>

          <p>If you are having trouble with a CAPTCHA, I encourage you to reach out
          to the website owner or administrator for assistance in resolving the issue.</p>
