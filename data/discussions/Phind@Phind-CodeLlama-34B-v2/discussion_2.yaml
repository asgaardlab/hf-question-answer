          <p>I saw the other post about this, but why delete the old repo, if you
          guys didnt use wizardcoder then you would have nothing to hide. You wouldnt
          need to delete the repo, you could just tell people a logical reason for
          why the config file was named (wizardcoder-34b) and it be settled. </p>

          <p>But you decided to act suspicious instead. Seems more likely that you
          stole the model than that you didnt based on your behavior alone...</p>

    run of WizardCoder. I am very disappointed in this but what can we do - we can
    never prove that they used WizardCoder.

    claims are demonstrably false**.'
