        html: '<p>Hi, thank you very much for your feedback!</p>

          <p>I tested it again, and could not reproduce the reported syntax error.
          It works as is now. So I was wondering if this could have been a version
          issue. So my sagemaker version is 2.159.0, what is your version?   Does
          it help at all if you <code>pip install -U sagemaker</code>? If so, I will
          document it in the readme. thanks</p>
