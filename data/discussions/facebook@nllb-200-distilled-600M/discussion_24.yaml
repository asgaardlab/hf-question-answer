        html: '<p>When translating from English to French, I find that it leaves off
          quite a bit of what I am trying to translate. For example, when prompted
          with "Hello, my name is John. What is your name? Unfortunately I don''t
          speak much French." The returned translation is "Je m''appelle John, et
          vous, comment vous appelez-vous ?"</p>

          <p>Is this due to the model size not being able to effectively pick up on
          the sentiment, temperature, or some other issue?</p>
