        html: '<p>I have run some tests using <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/foldl/chatllm.cpp">ChatLLM.cpp</a>.
          The results are quite good.</p>

          <p>Some examples:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You  &gt; find the peak of f(x) = 3 (x - 1)^2 - 5<br>A.I. &gt;<br>[Rewritten
          Answer]: To find the peak of the function f(x) = 3(x - 1)^2 - 5, we need
          to follow these steps:</p>

          <p>Step 1: Identify the quadratic function<br>The given function is a quadratic
          function in the form of f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c, where a = 3, b = -6, and c
          = -5.</p>

          <p>Step 2: Find the vertex of the parabola<br>The vertex of a parabola in
          the form of f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c is given by the formula:</p>

          <p>x_vertex = -b / (2a)</p>

          <p>Step 3: Plug in the values of a and b<br>Now, we will plug in the values
          of a and b that we found earlier:</p>

          <p>x_vertex = -(-6) / (2 * 3)</p>

          <p>Step 4: Simplify the expression<br>Simplify the expression to find the
          x-coordinate of the vertex:</p>

          <p>x_vertex = 6 / 6<br>x_vertex = 1</p>

          <p>Step 5: Find the y-coordinate of the vertex<br>Now that we have the x-coordinate
          of the vertex, we can find the y-coordinate by plugging it back into the
          function:</p>

          <p>f(1) = 3(1 - 1)^2 - 5</p>

          <p>Step 6: Simplify the expression<br>Simplify the expression to find the
          y-coordinate of the vertex:</p>

          <p>f(1) = 3(0)^2 - 5<br>f(1) = -5</p>

          <p>Step 7: State the final answer<br>The peak of the function f(x) = 3(x
          - 1)^2 - 5 is at the point (1, -5).</p>

          <p>The answer is: the peak of the function f(x) = 3(x - 1)^2 - 5 is at the
          point (1, -5).<br>You  &gt; is it the maximum or minimum of the function<br>A.I.
          &gt; The peak of a function is the highest or lowest point of the function.
          In this case, since the coefficient of the squared term (x - 1)^2 is positive
          (3), the parabola opens upwards, which means it has a minimum point. Therefore,
          the peak of the function f(x) = 3(x - 1)^2 - 5 is the minimum of the function.</p>
