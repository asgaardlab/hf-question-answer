          <p>You  &gt; There is a well with a depth of 10 meters. A frog is at the
          bottom of the well. The frog can jump up 5 meters each time, but due to
          the slippery wall, it will slide down 3 meters after each jump. How many
          times does the frog need to jump to get out of the well?<br>A.I. &gt; 1.
          The frog is at the bottom of the well, which is 10 meters deep.<br>2. The
          frog jumps up 5 meters, but due to the slippery wall, it slides down 3 meters.<br>3.
          After the first jump, the frog is now at a height of (10 - 5 + 3) = 8 meters.<br>4.
          The frog needs to jump again to reach the top of the well.<br>5. The frog
          jumps up 5 meters, but again slides down 3 meters.<br>6. After the second
          jump, the frog is now at a height of (8 - 5 + 3) = 6 meters.<br>7. The frog
          needs to jump again to reach the top of the well.<br>8. The frog jumps up
          5 meters, but slides down 3 meters.<br>9. After the third jump, the frog
          is now at a height of (6 - 5 + 3) = 4 meters.<br>10. The frog needs to jump
          again to reach the top of the well.<br>11. The frog jumps up 5 meters, but
          slides down 3 meters.<br>12. After the fourth jump, the frog is now at a
          height of (4 - 5 + 3) = 2 meters.<br>13. The frog needs to jump again to
          reach the top of the well.<br>14. The frog jumps up 5 meters, but slides
          down 3 meters.<br>15. After the fifth jump, the frog is now at a height
          of (2 - 5 + 3) = 0 meters.<br>16. The frog has reached the top of the well.</p>

          <p>The frog needs to jump 5 times to get out of the well.</p>

          <p>The answer is: 5.</p>
