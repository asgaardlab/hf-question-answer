        html: '<p>Wow this is soo amazing at coding! I''m going to do some tests and
          utilize this model immediately.</p>

          <p>It''s very slow compared to Zephyr 7b which is a big deal because it
          takes this model 7 seconds to generate shorter output versus Zephyr taking
          1.2 seconds and generating more output.</p>

          <p> But I found a neat hack is that since Zephyr has a 1024 context window
          you can inject the response from Zephyr and have this model expand the context
          window further. Since this one has 2048.</p>
