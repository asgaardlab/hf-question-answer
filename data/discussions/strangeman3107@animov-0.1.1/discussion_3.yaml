          I tried finetuning on images (about 10) of a known actress and it seemed
          to have no effect so I'm curious as to the size ( you mentioned thousands
          of videos ) of the dataset as well as the specific keywords the model was
          trained on. I've created a couple of LORAs and went in expecting the process
          to be similar
