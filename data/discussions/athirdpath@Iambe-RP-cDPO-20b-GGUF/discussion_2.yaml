          replies with intermixed quotes and narrative.  Then suddenly I''ll get a
          response that''s 75% narrative, plaintext/several lines of unitalicised
          text with no quotes, and it looks and reads like a story.  Often jumping
          to the end.  Sometimes even WITH a "The End." Other times I''ll get a "fair
          use disclaimer" or "content warning." Stuff that''s come from data that
          contained these things (storywriting models,  data from forum posts.)</p>

          <p>Rather than having an LLM that "can do both," and ends up with results
          like this, I''d prefer models that focus solely on good RP or storywriting,
          exclusively.  The RP one should be better at RP and the storywriting one
          better at storywriting that way.<br>Going forward, "cleaner" and "purer"
          data is the way forward.  Focus on what''s needed for the target use case
          and only use datasets which are formatted well for that purpose.  </p>

          <p>I suspect a lot of the weird artefacts we''re seeing in models is because

    \ Works okay for RP or a loose story request, but not so well under structure.\n\
    > \n> I've forked Iambe, by the way. This RP line will be focused on RP responsiveness\
    \ at the expense of story writing in the future, and [Iambe >Storyteller](athirdpath/Iambe-Storyteller-20b)\
    \ will be sacrificing RP ability for longer-form writing.\n\nI'm really glad someone\
    \ is doing this and thinking this way!\nI've noticed how a lot of people will\
    \ mix RP and storywriting models together, but in using LLMs I've noticed there\
    \ is a difference between an \"RP reply\" and a \"story reply.\" I can be having\
    \ a nice back-and-forth, 2-3 paragraph replies with intermixed quotes and narrative.\
    \  Then suddenly I'll get a response that's 75% narrative, plaintext/several lines\
    \ of unitalicised text with no quotes, and it looks and reads like a story.  Often\
    \ jumping to the end.  Sometimes even WITH a \"The End.\" Other times I'll get\
    \ a \"fair use disclaimer\" or \"content warning.\" Stuff that's come from data\
    \ that contained these things (storywriting models,  data from forum posts.)\n\
    \nRather than having an LLM that \"can do both,\" and ends up with results like\
    \ this, I'd prefer models that focus solely on good RP or storywriting, exclusively.\
    \  The RP one should be better at RP and the storywriting one better at storywriting\
    \ that way.\nGoing forward, \"cleaner\" and \"purer\" data is the way forward.\
    \  Focus on what's needed for the target use case and only use datasets which\
    \ are formatted well for that purpose.  \n\nI suspect a lot of the weird artefacts\
    \ we're seeing in models is because of inconsistently formatted datasets combined\
    \ with mixing datasets intended for different purposes."
