        html: '<p>First, greetings and many thanks for taking the time to create this
          model; I was looking for exactly this print effect by this artist. The results
          look very good. I want ask however about the reason for the very high number
          of iterations used in the example images and that it is seemingly required
          to produce results of that same quality. Why is the high number of steps
          needed, and are there any adjustments or strategies one can employ to produce
          the intended result of this model at a lower number of steps?</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>

        html: '<p>Sorry for the delay in noticing. I am glad you liked it.</p>

          <p>The reason for the large number of steps in the generated examples is
          to improve the quality as much as possible. Normally a lower number of steps
          would not be a problem, and I myself generate with such number of steps
          (for example 40).</p>
