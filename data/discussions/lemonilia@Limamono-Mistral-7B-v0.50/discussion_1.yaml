          The internal monologue is simply beautiful, it''s crazy how smart this model

          <p>I have found that the included instruction and context presets didn''t
          work great for me, the responses were short and dry, but to be fair my character
          card wasn''t following the suggested character description structure and
          the greeting message was fairly short. On the other hand the roleplay preset
          worked really well, I got longer and more descriptive responses. It also
          tended to generate more internal monologues.</p>

          <p>''Start Reply With'' feature was useful in this case if you wanted to
          guarantee internal dialogues which is what I used because they were just
          consistently really good. If anyone wants this just place a single asterisk
          or underscore.</p>

          <p>Thanks for your hard work, I haven''t seen any model like this before,
