          This is based on llama 2 rather than Mistral or Yi.  I''m very confident
          those are much stronger bases than llama 2 and so it''s not gonna be worth
          doing a dolphin finetune.


          Getting it into a 34b form to match Yi might take some very creative work
          (@winglian has done this kind of thing with Phi)


          I''m not sure it''s possible.  But I''m definitely looking into it.'
