          Maybe you can raise the issue to https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/dolphin-2.2-yi-34b-200k-GGUF/discussions.
          There definitely is something, somewhere.'

    Tried `tell me an interesting bed time story` with TheBloke''s Q4_K_M and Q5_K_M
    model on both koboldcpp and llamacpp for several times, having same problem here.
    Here are its output:
