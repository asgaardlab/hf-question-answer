          transcription was good like near perfect but the transcrition output of
          qwen did not capture whole transcription. I was trying it on hindi audio
          assuming whisper performance for hindi very good. Next i tried summarising
          audio but that also did not give proper results. Anyone who has tried qwen
          for languages supported by whisper? </p>
