        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>This model seems to run faster than one trained on CFAR10, but ,judging
          by the architecture, CFAR10 model is lighter. Furtermore, during DDIM inversion
          and reconstruction CFAR10 manages to reproduce images better.<br>What is
          the diffrence between these models, besides train data and architecture?</p>

          <p>Thankyou</p>
