  content: "> Hi @cckevinn, here's the code I used for this conversion:  https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1LLJewY92LXdeug5m_ceMUHdlqrRQwSQJ?usp=sharing\
    \ \n> \n> I can also share a GitHub repo with links to converted pretrained models\
    \ later this week. I'm also working on a sample code for fine-tuning pretrained\
    \ models directly in Transformers.\n\n@mys Thank you for sharing your awesome\
    \ work.\n\nWill the fine-tuning samples include [visual grounding](https://huggingface.co/spaces/OFA-Sys/OFA-Visual_Grounding)?\n\
    \nI would be interested to benchmark OFA vs Donut for UI RefExp task. Here is\
    \ my working in progress with Donut:\nhttps://huggingface.co/spaces/ivelin/ui-refexp\n\
    \nI know Visual Grounding is pre-trained on RefCoco family which is mostly physical\
    \ objects , while UI RefExp is primarily RICO android mobile app screenshots.\
    \ Nevertheless I am curious how fast OFA can transfer learn on RICO RefExp and\
    \ with what ultimate performance. Happy to share my results as I am with Donut."
