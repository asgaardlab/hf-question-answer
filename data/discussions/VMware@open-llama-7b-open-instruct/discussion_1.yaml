        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I would like to draw everyone''s attention to AWQ quantized version of
          <code>open-llama-7b-open-instruct</code> model at <a href="https://huggingface.co/abhinavkulkarni/open-llama-7b-open-instruct-w4-g128-awq">https://huggingface.co/abhinavkulkarni/open-llama-7b-open-instruct-w4-g128-awq</a>.</p>

          <p>For more on AWQ, click <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/mit-han-lab/llm-awq">here</a>.</p>

          <p>The quantized model size on disk is <code>3.89GB</code> vs <code>13.48GB</code>
          for the original model. Similar gains could be observed for VRAM usage.
          The perplexity is only worse by 5%.</p>

          <p>Please take a look and give it a try.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
