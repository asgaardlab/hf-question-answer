        html: '<p>Hi folks,</p>

          <p>This is probably a silly question, but in your readme you say, "I recommend
          Alpaca. ST Settings used for Test: Lightning 1.1 System Prompt + Shortwave(1.2
          Temperature)".</p>

          <p>As best I can figure, that "Shortwave(1.2 Temperature)" is the shortwave
          generation parameter set in Oogabooga with the temperature turned down to
          1.2, but I can''t for the life of me find any mention on the internet of
          "Lightning 1.1 System Prompt"</p>

          <p>What is the text of that system prompt?</p>
