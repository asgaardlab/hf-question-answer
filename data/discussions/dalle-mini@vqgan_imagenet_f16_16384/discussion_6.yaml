        html: '<p>this is great, please i wanted to ask a question, is it possible
          to reconstruct from indices that are not returned by the vqgan model, for
          instance, just to set a list containing integers like this: indices = jnp.array([[123,
          334, 453, 554, 34, 53, 54]]), shape of indices is (1, 7), then try to decode
          it with vqgan_model.decode_code(indices). i tried it but it is returning
          InconclusiveDimensionOperation: Cannot divide evenly the sizes of shapes
          (1, 7, 256) and (1, 4, 4, -1). after some checks, i found that the the indices
          returned by the vqgan_model.decode(image) has some additional properties
          that normal jnp.array dont have, which may be the reason for the issue.<br>can
          you please help me figure out a solution for this, i actually don''t want
          to train a vqgan model now which if i didn''t find solution i must do train
          a vqgan from scratch, which i don''t want to now.  thanks </p>
