        html: '<p>Indeed there are two parts of the paper. The first part is more
          like another variant of LoRa and as all the existing variants I think it

          <p>The second part is mostly the thing you are trying here as far as I understand.
          The trick on cross attention seems to be relevant, but it probably does
          not allow to go over two characters or have complex interaction. Anyway
          these things are fundamentally challenging for SD so I guess some more important
          work would be needed to achieve that.</p>
