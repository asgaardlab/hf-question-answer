        html: '<p>Good day,</p>

          <p>Thank you for sharing your interesting work! I was following the code
          example for ctranfomers but couldn''t get the LLM to generate due to this
          error: " CUDA error 222 at D:\a\ctransformers\ctransformers\models\ggml\ggml-cuda.cu:6045:
          the provided PTX was compiled with an unsupported toolchain."</p>

          <p>I''ve asked on the ctransformers github but got no responses so far :(
          Would you have any suggestions?</p>

          <p>Thanks so much!</p>
