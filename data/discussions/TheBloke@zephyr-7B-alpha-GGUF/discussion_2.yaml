        html: '<p>Thanks, I''ll close for now.</p>

          <p>I have suggested (in that same discussion) that they update the license
          to Apache 2.0, instead of MIT (since one is arguably bound to the Apache
          2.0 license from upstream anyway, given this is a finetune, if models are
          copyrightable, which I don''t think they are, but we assume they are when
          licensing), so that might change.</p>

          <p>The important thing is that it''s FLOSS now.</p>
