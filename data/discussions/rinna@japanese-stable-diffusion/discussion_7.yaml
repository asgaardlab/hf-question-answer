        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>Thanks so much for the effort!</p>

          <p>I converted the model to the "ckpt" file to be tested with a Gradio based
          framework; however, I am not sure about the exact configuration. </p>

          <p>There was a shape mismatch error while loading the model. If you can
          kindly share the "yaml" file that comes with the model, that would be much
          appreciated.</p>

          <p>Thanks very much and have a good day!</p>
