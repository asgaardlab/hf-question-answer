          sd21-unclip-h.ckpt was trained with a high level of regularization, which
          makes the model more robust to overfitting, but may also result in slightly
          lower performance on certain tasks.

          On the other hand, sd21-unclip-l.ckpt was trained with a lower level of
          regularization, which may result in higher performance on certain tasks,
          but could also make the model more prone to overfitting.
