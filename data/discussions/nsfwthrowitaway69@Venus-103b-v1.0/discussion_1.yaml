        html: '<p>I''ve been playing with the 3.35 on dual 3090''s and am feeling
          very spoiled by these models. The writing style is excellent, really good
          with descriptions and prose. Playing with  "Yes, My Liege" the conversations
          feel very much in the genre. Complex political situations requiring a cool
          head and intelligent response. The characters are on point in how they act
          towards a "liege". I''m also running the Lorebook and the 12k context here
          really shines. When asking for character descriptions I have had the model
          ignore some odd race info on the character card/start text for the extras,
          like switching a fox-folk Domestic Advisor to an elf. But otherwise the
          character descriptions were very good and matched their roles well. Instruction
          following is also good. If I''m doing an image generation prompt and ask
          for specific details like "period appropriate clothing and weapons" it follows
          instructions.  I haven''t really don''t long conversations so I can''t tell
          how good the model is with remembering prior items, especially in the longer
          context. I will also say the model isn''t too aggressive, especially in
          this playbook. I feel like that''s part of the model being good at following

          <p>I haven''t really messed with the other settings. Pretty much the defaults.
          The model just seems solid overall without much tweaking needed, aside from
          model settings/drivers needed to shove as much context size as possible
          into ram.</p>
