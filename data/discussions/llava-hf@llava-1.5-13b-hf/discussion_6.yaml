        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for the work. Is there a comparison on the benchmark
          scores after adding this implementation vs the original one? I also have
          another question which is can we use PEFT method to finetune this model
          (is there an example script)? Or how can we finetune it without converting
          the weights?</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
