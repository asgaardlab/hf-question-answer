        html: '<p>Hi, </p>

          <p>I am trying to deploy this model to SageMaker following the instructions
          in <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/inference#deploy-a-model-from-the-hub">https://huggingface.co/docs/sagemaker/inference#deploy-a-model-from-the-hub</a><br>What
          should be the value for HF_TASK for this model?</p>

          <p>I deployed the model using ImageToText value for HF_TASK and the inference
          is failing with this erorr:</p>

          <pre><code>I was able to deploy the model on Sagemaker but any calls to
          the model are failing right now with the error :

          OSError: /.sagemaker/mms/models/cooelf__Auto-UI does not appear to have
          a file named config.json. Checkout ''https://huggingface.co//.sagemaker/mms/models/cooelf__Auto-UI/None''
          for available files.

          </code></pre>

          <p>Thanks</p>
