          [`VMware/open-llama-13b-open-instruct`](https://huggingface.co/VMware/open-llama-13b-open-instruct)
          as a `base_model` field, situated in the `YAML` block of your model''s `README.md`.


          How did we find this information? We extracted this infromation from the

          **Why add this?** Enhancing your model''s metadata in this way:

          - **Boosts Discoverability** - It becomes straightforward to trace the relationships
          between various models on the Hugging Face Hub.

          - **Highlights Impact** - It showcases the contributions and influences
          different models have within the community.

          model connections, take a look at [librarian-bots/base_model_explorer](https://huggingface.co/spaces/librarian-bots/base_model_explorer).
