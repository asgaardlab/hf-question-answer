          <p>Sorry, but just because they could be breaking the law, it wouldn''t

          making that new work non-commercial. Here is what CC BY-NC 4.0 says regarding
          that definition:</p>

          <p>"Adapted Material means material subject to Copyright and Similar Rights
          that is derived from or based upon the Licensed Material and in which the

          Rights held by the Licensor. For purposes of this Public License, where
          the Licensed Material is a musical work, performance, or sound recording,
          Adapted Material is always produced where the Licensed Material is synched
          in timed relation with a moving image."</p>

          <p>Now one could argue that our models were "derived from" this data, although
          there is no easy way to see how. Since oasst uses multiple sources of data,
          tracking the weights that are affected by this dataset during backprop would
          be difficult, although not impossible. The simplest way to solve this argument
          would be to not include this dataset, which is why I was confused. I''m
          not a lawyer so I may be completely mistaken, but in this case, it will
          come down to arguing the model falls under Adapted Material.</p>

          THE LAW because it might not be enforced any time in the future?


          Do you really want to drag OA to the ground by allowing these companies
          to dig up dirt on it? Do you want people to gossip about how the model only
          works because of data from OpenAI? Do you want people to never believe that
          everything we do is truly open source just because "there are benefits to
          using the data"?


          Are you willing to put EVERY SINGLE USER in risk of getting their future
          models banned because they unknowingly used out models that was never really
          open source in the first place, just because "one could argue it''s from
          a derived model"?

    Are you seriously PUBLICLY debating wether or not we should WILLINGLY BREAK THE

          rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027">https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.00027</a></p>

          <p>"7.1 Legality of Content<br>While the machine learning community has
          be-<br>gun to discuss the issue of the legality of training<br>models on
          copyright data, there is little acknowl-<br>edgment of the fact that the
          processing and dis-<br>tribution of data owned by others may also be a<br>violation
          of copyright law. As a step in that direc-<br>tion, we discuss the reasons
          we believe that our<br>use of copyright data is in compliance with US<br>copyright
          law.16<br>Under pre (1984) (and affirmed in subsequent<br>rulings such as
          aff (2013); Google (2015)), non-<br>commercial, not-for-profit use of copyright
          media<br>is preemptively fair use. Additionally, our use is<br>transformative,
          in the sense that the original form<br>of the data is ineffective for our
          purposes and our<br>form of the data is ineffective for the purposes of<br>the
          original documents. Although we use the full<br>text of copyright works,
          this is not necessarily dis-<br>qualifying when the full work is necessary
          (ful,<br>2003). In our case, the long-term dependencies in<br>natural language
          require that the full text be used in<br>order to produce the best results
          (Dai et al., 2019;<br>Rae et al., 2019; Henighan et al., 2020; Liu et al.,<br>2018).<br>Copyright
          law varies by country, and there may be<br>additional restrictions on some
          of these works in<br>particular jurisdictions. To enable easier compli-<br>ance
          with local laws, the Pile reproduction code is<br>available and can be used
          to exclude certain com-<br>ponents of the Pile which are inappropriate for<br>the

          "7.1 Legality of Content

          While the machine learning community has be-

          gun to discuss the issue of the legality of training

          models on copyright data, there is little acknowl-

          edgment of the fact that the processing and dis-

          tribution of data owned by others may also be a

          violation of copyright law. As a step in that direc-

          tion, we discuss the reasons we believe that our

          use of copyright data is in compliance with US

          copyright law.16

          Under pre (1984) (and affirmed in subsequent

          rulings such as aff (2013); Google (2015)), non-

          commercial, not-for-profit use of copyright media

          is preemptively fair use. Additionally, our use is

          transformative, in the sense that the original form

          of the data is ineffective for our purposes and our

          form of the data is ineffective for the purposes of

          the original documents. Although we use the full

          text of copyright works, this is not necessarily dis-

          qualifying when the full work is necessary (ful,

          2003). In our case, the long-term dependencies in

          natural language require that the full text be used in

          order to produce the best results (Dai et al., 2019;

          Rae et al., 2019; Henighan et al., 2020; Liu et al.,

          2018).

          Copyright law varies by country, and there may be

          additional restrictions on some of these works in

          particular jurisdictions. To enable easier compli-

          ance with local laws, the Pile reproduction code is

          available and can be used to exclude certain com-

          ponents of the Pile which are inappropriate for

          the user. Unfortunately, we do not have the meta-
