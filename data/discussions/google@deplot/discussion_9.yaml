        html: '<p>What would be some of the ways to adapt this model to other languages
          (with non-alphabets)?</p>

          <p>I have tried to extend the tokenizer vocabulary with the target language
          and have been fine-tuning. The loss seems to converge (currently around
          11 -&gt; 3) but when I make an inference, the results doesn''t seem to effectively
          convey the chartplot and spits out some random ascii codes such as 0xEB
          and 0xA7.</p>

          <p>What would be some other ways to adapt this english model to other languages?
          Or should I keep trying fine-tuning with the extended vocabulary until the
          loss converges even more (preferably around 0)?</p>
