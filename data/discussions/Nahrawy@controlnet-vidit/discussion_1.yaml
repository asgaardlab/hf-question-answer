          \ I was looking for something like this for quite sometime. Can you share\
          \ more information into how to use it. I saw the prompts but needed more\
          \ understanding on how to use it with more than one controlnet. There are\
          \ two parameters other than prompts, but I fully didn't get what to make\
          \ sense of them. Also, since it is from Inpainting model v1.5, is it possible\
          \ to not specify the lighting at all and get the controlnet to auto generate\
          \ perfect lighting? </p>\n<p>Usecase:</p>\n<p>I have a product in a very\
          \ bright lighting, and a background image is in different lighting. I want\
          \ to combine both of them. However, the lighting seems to be playing an\
          \ issue here. Would love to understand how to use this for the mentioned\
          \ usecase.\n </p>\n"
