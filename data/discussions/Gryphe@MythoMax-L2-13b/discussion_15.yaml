        html: '<p>This may not be an issue with this repo specifically but i think
          its a bug that the tokenizer decode() function removes any whitespace before
          the first character which is an issue when decoding the tokens one by one
          as it removes the spacing. Is there a specific function or a kwarg I can
          use to get the proper whitespace?</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/630d4de1b66f088d547f22b4/wlF1dcWfZHbk7wzv3b8oT.png"><img

          <p>Once again, I am new to all this stuff so this may be a question for
          whoever made the tokenizer but I couldnt get info on which one it is.</p>
