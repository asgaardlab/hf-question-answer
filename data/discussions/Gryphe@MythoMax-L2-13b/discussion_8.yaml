        html: '<p>I just wanted to put my appreciation here for this amazing model!<br>I''ve
          tried quite a lot of 13B models, but this has turned out to be the winner.
          Good coherence, good reasoning skills and great for Character based chat!</p>

          <p>I can recommend using the GGML q6 version found on TheBloke. And use
          Mirostat 2 setting with a tau of 5 and 0.1 in the last parameter.</p>

          <p>I had some weirdness happening with the GPTQ model after a very long
          chat session, but that might have been because of wrong parameter settings.</p>
