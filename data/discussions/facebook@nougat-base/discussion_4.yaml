        html: '<p>Hello Facebook,</p>

          <p>My understanding of the donut model is that it receives image into a
          pretrained donut processor and passes a vectorized representation to the
          base donut model.<br>Given that the github repo for nougat does some preprocessing
          on pdf and html files for building and finetuning datasets, if I wish to
          finetune the model on specific images instead of pdfs and raw text per image,
          would I be able to do so using the same procedure as the base donut model?</p>

          <p>Thank you!<br>Bardia</p>

          <p><code>DonutProcessor</code> is not really "pretrained", it''s just an
          object that prepares the image for the model. It will basically convert
          a Pillow image (or NumPy array) to a PyTorch tensor called <code>pixel_values</code>,
          by resizing the image and normalizing the color channels. The reason we
          do <code>processor = DonutProcessor.from_pretrained("facebook/nougat-base")</code>
          is to make sure that the preprocessing settings are used for the model at
          "facebook/nougat-base".</p>

          <p>Thanks for reaching out with a quick response and explanation. Given
          your explanation,  I assume everything else remains standard to the donut
          model. I had follow-up questions like image size and token length but found
          the answers in the paper. Thanks for reaching out. I''ll post any further
          issues I might have in the discussion as I start playing around with it.
