        html: '<p>The model card doesn''t seem to offer details or info on how the
          Instruct and Chat versions were RLHF''d/instruction-tuned. This is what
          the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://together.ai/blog/redpajama-models-v1">release
          blog post</a> says:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-7B-v0.1 is its chat counterpart trained over Dolly
          2.0 and Open Assistant<br>RedPajama-INCITE-Instruct-7B-v0.1 is instruction
          tuned for few-shot applications. We follow the recipe for GPT-JT but eliminate
          all datasets that overlap with the HELM benchmark. </p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>Perhaps add this to the model card? And it would be useful to specify
          exactly which datasets were included / excluded, to spare interested users
          the trouble of figure out what the HELM benchmark includes and how it does
          or does not overlap with GPT-JT.</p>
