          for you to quantize my model. I just finished uploading the FP16 file to
          this repo. Please tell me if it works, I''m 99% sure I used the most recent
          version of llama.cpp to convert it (spent a lot of yesterday upgrading packages
          and software versions) but "it works on my machine" is never a guarantee.</p>

          <p>This repo, <a href="https://huggingface.co/Heralax/MythoMakiseMerged-13b">https://huggingface.co/Heralax/MythoMakiseMerged-13b</a>

          that version isn''t merged with MythoMax. I really need to get better at
          organizing my HF repos lol.</p>

          <p>Anyway, thanks for coming by, and for all your work in the community!</p>
