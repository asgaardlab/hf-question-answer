        html: '<p>Hey all,</p>

          <p>I have been trawling HF to find a example of a demo I seen recently -
          a script which converted a whole JavaScript project to Python. Does anyone
          know if the starcoder model can do this? I am a little lost as to where
          to start.</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance</p>
