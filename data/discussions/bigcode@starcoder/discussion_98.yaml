        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I would like to finetune StarCoder for languages that are not present
          in The Stack dataset. How can i prepare a custom dataset and use it with
          the finetuning process? The different languages of the-stack dataset are
          stored are parquet files. How can I generated such files for further languages?</p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Toni</p>
