        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I wanted a way to experiment with calling this model from the command
          line without having to run it locally, so I wrote <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/arkraieski/starcoder-cli">this
          CLI</a> wrapping the Hugging Face JS library. I figure this is as good of
          a place as any to show this off to others that are interested in playing
          around with inference with this model.</p>

          <p>I''m not sure exactly where I''ll go with this in the future, but I welcome
          any contributions, feedback, questions, forks, etc</p>
