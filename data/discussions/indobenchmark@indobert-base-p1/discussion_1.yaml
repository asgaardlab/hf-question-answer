        html: '<p>Hi there, so basically the pretraining dataset for <code>indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1</code>
          and <code>indolem/indobert-base-uncased</code> are completely different.<br><code>indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1</code>
          is trained on Indo4B corpus which is around ~3.6B words, while <code>indolem/indobert-base-uncased</code>
          is trained on Wikipedia, news articles and Indonesian Web Corpus with a
          total of 220M words. Pretraining hyperparameter of each model is also different.</p>

          <p>We also have an existing project working which compares several Indonesian
          models for multiple downstream tasks (the project is still on-going so we
          cannot share the detail of the result yet). Based on our result, we found
          that <code>indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1</code> outperforms <code>indolem/indobert-base-uncased</code>
          on most of the tasks. Additionally, there is also <code>indobenchmark/indobert-large-p1</code>
          which is the larger version of  the <code>indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1</code>.
          So, if a better evaluation result of the model is critical in your use case,
          I would suggest to use <code>indobenchmark/indobert-base-p1</code>.</p>

          <p>Hope it helps!</p>
