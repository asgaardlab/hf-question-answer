        html: '<p>Hi SundayPunch,</p>

          <p>I''ve been fiddling with your model off and on for a couple of months
          and just can''t seem to get cohesive images.  Aircraft are asymmetrical,
          trucks or equipment look like they''re stacked and melted together, and
          anything in space generally suffers from skewed perspective to the point
          that they just look funky.</p>

          <p>I''ve been unable to generate anything even close to the quality of your
          sample images, so I was curious if there''s any special term or style I
          should use for better images.  I''d appreciate any pointers because I like
          the ''hard sci-fi'' look your samples have and would like to accomplish
          something similar.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

        html: '<p>Hey, sounds like you are having the sort of problems that can come
          from trying image sizes too far off from the native 512*512px resolution
          the model was trained on. Try generating  images with at least one dimension
          close to 512 and see if that helps. You can try upscaling afterwards. Also,
          SD in general doesn''t have a very good idea what a spaceship or aircraft
          looks like. It''s better with some vehicles like cars/trucks, and better
          still with most kinds of structure. I have found symmetry is a problem for
          SD, it doesn''t really understand it very well. I think we don''t notice
          as much with buildings, landscapes etc since it''s not so important, however
          an asymmetric aircraft just looks immediately silly. You might also have
          better results using this model in img2img mode from a source image. </p>

          <p>The sample images were generated with pretty simple prompts, here are
          a couple of examples below.</p>

          <p>combotechsf, dilapidated desert truss structure<br>Steps: 100, Sampler:
          DPM++ 2S a, CFG scale: 10, Seed: 1049527356, Size: 960x512, Model hash:
          2f5159bf, Wildcard prompt: "combotechsf, <strong>adjective</strong> <strong>style</strong>

          <p>I generally run 512x768 or 768x512 with Hires. fix set for the same dimensions
          for clarity and sharpness.  I''ve tried low steps with DPM++ sampling methods
          and 100+ steps with Euler A and DDIM, all with wildly varying rates of success.
          I''d estimate that 1 in 75 is without merged, morphed, or stacking issues.</p>

          <p>I''m in agreement with you about the symmetry issue.  Fore and aft facing
          cockpits on a fighter does look pretty silly, especially when the thrust
          nozzles are next to both.  </p>

          <p>Was that your MEGASTRUCTURE post on Reddit?  I found it last night and
          played around with some of your prompts, but didn''t see any noticeable
          differences to what I''ve already been generating.</p>

          <p>I''ll give the wildcard recommendation a shot.  I''ve not yet played
          with those settings, so time to learn something new.</p>
