          model is very nice and is a must-have for me.<br>However, a problem exists.<br>Because

          <p>Without Textual Inversion, it is difficult to use NegativePrompt to control
          strange limbs, and ControlNet is very useful to fix poses.</p>

          <p>So please create a model that is compatible with 1.5, it would be greatly
          appreciated...</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I don''t have a plan to make it compatible with SD 1.5.</p>

          <p>However, I hear alfredplpl and some other people are working on making
          controlnet available for SD 2.1.</p>

          <p>I think it will be public soon, so please wait until then.</p>
