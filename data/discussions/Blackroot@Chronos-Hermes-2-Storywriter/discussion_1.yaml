        html: '<p>Hey,</p>

          <p>I just wanted to say it''s been the first time my models looked like
          they had soul when writing stories, and that''s thanks to your lora!<br>I
          don''t know what dataset you used to make this, but that works fantastic!<br>I''m
          actually using this lora on others models such as llama chat or llama airoboros
          for example, because it''s a lora it''s like a wild horse, it makes the
          model harder to control, but when you got it rolling it''s marvelous!</p>

          <p>I just wanted to know if you decided to go further with this? Like making
          a finetune instead of a lora, or else making a lora with only the storytelling
          dataset you seem to have so that adding that to any llama2 models would
          simply increasing their creativity without them loosing their smartness
          I would say</p>

          <p>I think they already made one that''s based on the base llama2 model.
