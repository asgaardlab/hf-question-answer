          <p>It was only train on English so I wouldn''t recommend for any other languages.<br>For
          french I trained another one which was working pretty well for my use case:<br>Jean-Baptiste/camembert-ner</p>

          <p>There are also other model that were train for multiple languages like:<br>Davlan/distilbert-base-multilingual-cased-ner-hrl</p>

          <p>I am not sure if it supports Danish though, but I am pretty sure you
          can find one which does.</p>
