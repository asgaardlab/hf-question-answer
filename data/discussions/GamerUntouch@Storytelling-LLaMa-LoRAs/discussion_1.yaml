        html: '<p>I''m curious what the dataset is and if that''s not possible, I
          totally understand. I use your model in a great quantity of my merges and
          it excels at making longer responses and prose highly improved. Works fantastic
          with instruct merges etc. Thought I''m aiming to make a new merge type and
          it''s going more NSFW focused.</p>

          <p>Is there quality material for that sort of thing in this LoRA? Thank
          you in advance and also big thank you for making these amazing models. If
          you release a lovecraft 30b I''d love to make a 13/30b model series release
          with existential horror as the focus as well.</p>

          <p>Appreciate it.</p>
