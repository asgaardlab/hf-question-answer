        html: '<p>It has no issues with common things like dirt, stone, and cobblestone.
          As soon as you try anything rarer, it has some trouble, e.g. the floor textures
          for "ocean floor", "treacherous terrain covered with green slime" or even
          "snowy ground" which never looks snow-covered. I would like a way to prompt
          it to be more "creative" and allow for a fantasy color palette that might
          not be prevalent in the training set, yet still follow tiling rules.</p>
