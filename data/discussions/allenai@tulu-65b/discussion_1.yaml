        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for the effort to making this model accessible!</p>

          <p>I wanted to obtain an access to this model, which requires me to agree
          to the terms and condtions:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p> I agree to abide by the terms of the license associated to this artifact,
          including domain and used-based restrictions</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>And, it seems that the terms and conditions are written inside LICENSE.txt:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>This model is licensed under the AI model license given in LICENSE.txt
          along with the original Llama license (llama_license.txt).</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>The problem is that you cannot see LICENSE.txt unless you have obtained
          access to the model. It seems 232 people who downloaded the model already
          didn''t care about this, but could you consider putting the LICENSE on the
          model card or have it accessible by other means?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
