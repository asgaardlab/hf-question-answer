        raw: 'In this benchmark study, we conducted a comparison between two distinct

          The first version, known as the `poc` (proof of concept) tagger, represents
          the initial development stage. On the other hand, we have the latest iteration,
          denoted as `23.08`, which has been enhanced and fine-tuned using documents
          from the publication office.


          The `poc` version of the Eurovoc Tagger is accessible through the [DAS platform](https://das-itec-innovation.eu/),
          while the more advanced `23.08` production version can be found on [our
          private Hugging Face endpoint](https://huggingface.co/EuropeanParliament/eurovoc_en).


          For a comprehensive and unbiased evaluation, both models were assessed using
          a dataset comprising 641 documents published in September 2023. It is important
          to note that these documents were never part of the training data for either
          version of the Eurovoc Tagger.



          | Metrics |   poc   |  23.08  | gain |

          |---------|---------|---------|------|

          | NDCG@3  |  0.5239 |  0.7071 | +35% |

          | NDCG@5  |  0.4583 |  0.6353 | +38% |

          | NDCG@10 |  0.4253 |  0.5863 | +37% |



          > NB: the micro F1 score cannot be computed since the `poc` doesn''t allow
          to retrieve all probabilities.



          ## Background information on the NDCG


          NDCG stands for `Normalized Discounted Cumulative Gain.` It''s a way to
          measure how good a search engine or recommendation system is at giving you
          the best results. Let''s imagine that you''re search for something on the
          internet, you get a list of results.


          **Normalized**: This means making sure the result is on a scale that''s
          easy to understand. It''s like giving scores to the results.


          **Discounted**: It takes into account that the results you see at the top
          are more important than the ones at the bottom. If you find what you want
          at the top, it''s worth more than something you find at the bottom of the
          list.


          **Cumulative**: This means adding up all the scores as you go down the list.
          The better results get higher scores, and you add them up to see how good
          the overall list is.


          **Gain**: This is like saying how good or helpful a result is. If a result
          is what you were looking for, it gets a high score. If it''s not what you
          wanted, it gets a low score.


          So, NDCG is a way to measure how well a search engine or recommendation
          system ranks its results. The higher the NDCG score, the better it is at
          showing you the most helpful stuff at the top of the list when you search
          for something.'
