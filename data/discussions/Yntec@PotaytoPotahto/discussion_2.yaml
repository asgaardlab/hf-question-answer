    I misread the model''s licence and thought I was allowed to do what I did, the
    model has been removed and can no longer be downloaded from this page. I''m in
    the process of replacing the Diffusers version with a dummy one because of the
    following technical problem:


    When a model is removed from  https://huggingface.co/ , all Spaces referencing
    it break, and can no longer be built, potatoMash is referenced by 10 Spaces, if
    this page was removed those spaces would no longer work, when andite removed his
    models many spaces broke and they never returned as changing the spaces'' code
    is not trivial.


    Until this technical issue is resolved (i.e. when the Space doesn''t find a model
    and throws an error but it can be built and run, as opposed to now where it stops
    building) something needs to be in https://huggingface.co/Yntec/potatoMash/ to
    avoid Spaces breaking, so I''ll replace the Diffusers version with a Stable Diffusion
    1.5 Diffusers dummy, and later on with an unrelated model with the same name,
    as something needs to be here so those spaces can run.'
