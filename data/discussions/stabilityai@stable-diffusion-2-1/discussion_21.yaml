        html: '<p>I noticed you started incorporating depth within stable diffusion
          2, which seems like a good, logical step! Have you considered just using
          a 3d kernel branch in the model itself? I''ve found 3d kernels can actually
          infer the depth dimension from 2d images, model depth within the kernels,
          and use it for better inference, especially on depth-related imaging, like
          hands, faces, etc. Here is the article along with code links to GitHub:
