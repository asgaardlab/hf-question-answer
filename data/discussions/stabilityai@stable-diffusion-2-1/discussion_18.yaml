        html: '<p>Is it possible to access a list of all of the images  that were
          censored from the original LAION dataset (i.e. the SAMPLE_ID for each censored
          image), for those of us whose tender eyes will not be harmed by NSFW imagery?
          If it is not available currently, would the devs be willing to make it available?
          It would be nice to be able to train custom models on the missing information.
          Thanks!</p>
