          <li>Try higher resolution - 768x768 and higher. SD 2.1 model is trained
          on 768x768 images and it''s going to make bad images if you set smaller
          than that. Try 1024x1024.</li>

          <li>Use more words to describe the image. Example:<br>  A Japanese woman,
          wide shot, ultrarealistic uhd faces, Kodak Ultramax 800, pexels, 85mm, casual
          pose, 35mm film roll photo, hard light, detailed skin texture, masterpiece,
          sharp focus, pretty, perfect, super model, adorable, attractive, Hasselblad,
          candid street portrait : 6</li>

          <li>Do you use negative prompt? That is very important for making realistic
          images. Here is one example of negative prompt:<br>  blender, cropped, lowres,
          poorly drawn face, out of frame, poorly drawn hands, double, blurred, disfigured,
          deformed, repetitive, black and white : -2</li>
