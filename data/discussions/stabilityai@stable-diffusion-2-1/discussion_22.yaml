    People are trying their best to answer questions and your subconscious is picking
    a word arrogant for whom ? Who is your subconscious are talking to ? Other guy
    or yourself. May be it is begging you not to be arrogant this way.  I am a mechanical
    engineer and programmer. If these questions are simple, and if explaining them
    to someone who knows nothing technical is simple why don''t you give it a try
    and get an engineering and programming degree and explain things to us. Again,
    "maybe"  we will learn something.'

          <p>Here''s a Tweet from Tanishq who works part-time with stabilityAI:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1601011140934664193">https://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1601011140934664193</a></p>

          <p>And this is from Google Bard:</p>

          <p>You can use either EMA or Non-EMA Stability Diffusion model for personal
          and commercial use. However, there are some things to keep in mind.</p>

          <ul>

          <li>EMA is more stable and produces more realistic results, but it is also
          slower to train and requires more memory.</li>

          <li>Non-EMA is faster to train and requires less memory, but it is less
          stable and may produce less realistic results.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Ultimately, the best choice for you will depend on your specific needs
          and preferences. If you are not sure which option to choose, I recommend
          starting with EMA and then experimenting with Non-EMA if you are not satisfied
          with the results.</p>

          <p>Here are some additional details about EMA and Non-EMA:</p>

          <ul>

          <li><p>EMA is created by averaging the weights of the model over a certain
          number of steps. This helps to smooth out the noise in the training data
          and produce more stable results.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>Non-EMA is the raw model, which means that it is not averaged over
          any steps. This makes it faster to train, but it also makes it more prone
          to overfitting.</p>

          </li>

          </ul>

          <p>Here are some examples of when you might want to use EMA:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>When you want to generate high-quality images.</li>

          <li>When you are short on time.</li>

          <li>When you are using a less powerful computer.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Here are some examples of when you might want to use Non-EMA:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>When you need to generate images quickly.</li>

          <li>When you are experimenting with different parameters.</li>

          <li>When you are using a powerful computer with a lot of memory.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>TLDR: An employee from stabilityAI recommends using EMA. start with EMA
          and then experiment with Non-EMA if you are not satisfied with the results.</p>

  content: "I'm also new on this. \n\nHere's a Tweet from Tanishq who works part-time\
    \ with stabilityAI:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/iScienceLuvr/status/1601011140934664193\n\
    \nAnd this is from Google Bard:\n\nYou can use either EMA or Non-EMA Stability\
    \ Diffusion model for personal and commercial use. However, there are some things\
    \ to keep in mind.\n\n+ EMA is more stable and produces more realistic results,\
    \ but it is also slower to train and requires more memory.\n+ Non-EMA is faster\
    \ to train and requires less memory, but it is less stable and may produce less\
    \ realistic results.\n\nUltimately, the best choice for you will depend on your\
    \ specific needs and preferences. If you are not sure which option to choose,\
    \ I recommend starting with EMA and then experimenting with Non-EMA if you are\
    \ not satisfied with the results.\n\nHere are some additional details about EMA\
    \ and Non-EMA:\n\n+ EMA is created by averaging the weights of the model over\
    \ a certain number of steps. This helps to smooth out the noise in the training\
    \ data and produce more stable results.\n\n+ Non-EMA is the raw model, which means\
    \ that it is not averaged over any steps. This makes it faster to train, but it\
    \ also makes it more prone to overfitting.\n\nHere are some examples of when you\
    \ might want to use EMA:\n\n+ When you want to generate high-quality images.\n\
    + When you are short on time.\n+ When you are using a less powerful computer.\n\
    \nHere are some examples of when you might want to use Non-EMA:\n\n+ When you\
    \ need to generate images quickly.\n+ When you are experimenting with different\
    \ parameters.\n+ When you are using a powerful computer with a lot of memory.\n\
    \nTLDR: An employee from stabilityAI recommends using EMA. start with EMA and\
    \ then experiment with Non-EMA if you are not satisfied with the results."
