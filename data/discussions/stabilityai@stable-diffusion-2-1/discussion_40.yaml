          <p>Input Nodes for SD2.1:<br>sample - [2,4,64,64],timestep [-1] and encoder_hidden_states

          <p>Still I do get the inferenced image as 512x512 since vae_decoder takes
          latents input of shape 512x512 and that results in a pixelated image. What
          are the shapes used for the above three nodes for proper inferencing<br><a

          <p>With these inputs the output was proper for SD1.4 models also tried using
          the <code>DPMSolverMultistepScheduler</code> for SD2.1 still the output
          is the same.</p>

          <p>Saw somewhere the encoder_hidden_states blob shape was updated ? What
          are the right dimensions to be used ? </p>
