        html: '<p>Hello</p>

          <p>I am on the dolly journey</p>

          <p>I started testing this on a macbook and got to 1h40 per response.<br>Then
          moved to a dedicated server with a random GPU with 8 core ... 20 minutes<br>Now
          I am in google cloud on a NVDIA T4 16 vCPU with 60GB memory .. I got it
          down to 4 minutes per answer</p>

          <p>my goal is to get to a few secs, what would be your recommendations ?
          I read I need a NVDIA A100 but I can''t provision that on google cloud (not
          a single available) not on AWS (they decline the request all the time)</p>

          <p>Thanks for your help !</p>
