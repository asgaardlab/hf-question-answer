        html: '<p>Hey, really loved your project. I have recently started exploring
          the area of DS and will love if you can guide me for one of my own problem
          statements. I have just been working on a project on how can I reduce noise
          in the ecosystem by just filtering non-crypto related messages. Eg Telegram
          chats have a lot of messages, how can I just filter out messages/conversation
          which I don''t care about. I guess we can extend your model to that as well.
          I know this might be a noob question, but thats what I am right now. Will
          love if you can guide me!</p>
