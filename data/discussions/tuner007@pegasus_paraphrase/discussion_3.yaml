        html: '<p>I have tested the model and am very impressed with its inference.
          Currently, I am also training a similar paraphrase model for Vietnamese,
          but the results are often grammatically incorrect and do not retain the
          entities in the sentence. Any suggestions to keep entities in a sentence?<br>Currently
          there is no PEGASUS model for Vietnamese language, so I use T5 instead.
          Is that part of the problem?</p>
