        html: '<p>The code works fine but I have a big problem. It makes the paraphrased
          text really short. For example the original text is two sentences long and
          50 characters. The paraphrased version is 1 sentence long and only 25-30
          characters.</p>

          <p>How can I make sure the output is longer?<br>Also what is num_beams =
          10? I tried playing a bit with the number but I don''t see much difference.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
