        html: '<p>Like the title suggests - I wanted to load this model in my local
          ooba install - but it seems unable to. I''m sure this is known, but I cannot
          resolve it on my own - the error seems to be related to missing files in
          the model directory - especially the "tokenizer.config" file and all other
          tokenizer-relevant ones.</p>

          <p>If this is purely a user error, feel free to close this and reply with
          a proper solution =) Thanks for trying to improve RP models on this scale!</p>

          <p>Edit: Loads flawlessly now. Thank you!</p>
