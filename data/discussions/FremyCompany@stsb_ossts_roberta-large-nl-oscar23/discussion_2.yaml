          <p>That should not affect the results in any way though, the fix is purely
          cosmetic (at least until someone fine-tunes).</p>

          <p>Ideally, this model should be retrained with the fixed base model, but
          even then it should not make a measurable difference for Dutch content.
          I''ll have to retrain anyway when I release the final OS STS dataset, and
          I''ll depreciate this model when I release the next one.</p>
