        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>thanks for your work!</p>

          <p>The <a href="https://huggingface.co/openflamingo/OpenFlamingo-9B-vitl-mpt7b#evaluation">performance</a>
          on VQAv2 of this 9B model is 50.3, 50.5, 52.8, 52.3 and 50.5 from 0 to 32
          shots. However, in the openflamingo paper Table 4, the 0, 4, 32 shot got
          52.7, 54.8, and 53.3 which are better than 50.3, 50.5 and 50.5 respectively.
          The same applies to OK-VQA.<br>My reproduction presents 51.28, 53.43 and
          53.5 given 0, 4, 8 shots respectively. </p>

          <p>Question 1, why there is such differences between scores in this model
          card and the reported scores in the OF paper? </p>

          <p>Question 2, I cannot reproduce the score compared to the paper, any suggestions?
          </p>

          <p>Best regards.</p>
