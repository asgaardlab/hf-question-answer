        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I''ve been using this model for correcting  interview transcriptions
          in German and I''ve noticed a peculiar pattern that I wanted to share with
          the community and the developers. It seems that the model exhibits a strong
          bias towards using periods (full stops) instead of question marks at the
          end of questions. This happens quite frequently, leading to a slight misrepresentation
          in the tone and clarity of the questions being asked.</p>

          <p>Unfortunately, I am unable to share specific examples as they are not
          suitable for publication.</p>

          <p>I understand that language processing, especially in multilingual contexts,
          can be quite challenging. However, I believe addressing this particular
          issue could significantly improve the model''s performance for German language
          interviews.</p>

          <p>I thought it was important to bring this to your attention. I appreciate
          all the hard work that went into this model as It improved and complemented
          the transcription process of interviews a lot!</p>

          <p>Thank you for considering this feedback.</p>

          <p>Best regards.</p>
