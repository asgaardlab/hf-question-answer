        html: '<p>Thanks for the detailed and precise way you''ve documented the recommended
          sampler settings and prompting. I''d love if this were the standard for
          all models. It makes me curious to try the model (but I haven''t yet since
          I still have some setup to do before I can run it).</p>

          <p>If you don''t mind, I have a question about recommended formatting as
          well, specifically for description, greeting message, and user messages.
          (If you''ve only tried it one way, then it''s still interesting to hear
          what you used in your testing.) For example:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Description: Do you prefer unstructured description (i.e. ordinary prose)
          or structured description (such as W++)?</li>

          <li>Message formatting: How do you prefer using quotes and asterisks? Novelistic
          style (<code>I do an action. "Hello."</code>), roleplay style (<code>*Action.*
          Hello.</code>), or something else?</li>

          <li>Message pronouns: My impression is that the usual choice here is third-person
          pronouns in all cases aside from the user referring to themselves in first
          person. Do you use that style or something else?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Sorry for all the questions. I''m just very curious what you find to
          be "best practice".</p>

        html: '<p>I''m glad you find the recommended settings helpful. They''re intended
          to be a starting point, and I will update them in light of more recent experiments.
          Please check them again before you try the model.<br>I''ll do my best to
          give some answers to your questions, although I would shy away from calling
          any of this best practice. It''s just what I do and it works for me, but
          you should feel free to experiment and find what works best for you (and
          what the model will handle gracefully).</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Description -- For character cards, I use the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://rentry.co/alichat">Ali:Chat
          approach</a>. I use that for static character details and put short-term
          dynamic details and information in the author''s note in SillyTavern using
          a less structured approach. It''s mostly free prose, maybe presented as
          a list. For system instructions during the chat, I tend to write them out
          as full sentences but other approaches probably work too.</li>

          <li>Message formatting -- I prefer a novelistic style with asterisks used
          to highlight characters'' first-person thoughts, but you should have no
          problem using any style you want. Just provide the model with an example
          of the formatting you want and it should be able to follow it.</li>

          <li>Message pronouns: I prefer a first-person POV for my character. I like
          a model that can be flexible with POV for the other characters because sometimes
          I prefer third-person and other times I like a first-person perspective
          for their messages.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>I hope you enjoy Rogue Rose. I recommend you also try Aurora Nights if
          you like this model, and keep your eyes open for a new release from me in
          the next week that I think eclipses them both.</p>
