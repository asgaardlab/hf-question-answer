          <li>For training the model, I used the labelled tweets from the ANTiVax\
          \ dataset [1], located here: <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/sakibsh/ANTiVax/tree/main/Labeled\"\
          >https://github.com/sakibsh/ANTiVax/tree/main/Labeled</a>. Each tweet is\
          \ labelled as 1 (is misinformation) or 0 (is not misinformation) in the\
          \ <code>VaxMisinfoData.csv</code> file. The Twitter IDs of each tweet are\
          \ listed in the <code>ids.txt</code> file. In order to access information\
          \ about each tweet from its tweet ID, including the content of the tweet,\
          \ I used the Hydrator app (<a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator\"\
          >https://github.com/DocNow/hydrator</a>), which extracts the information\
          \ about each of the tweet IDs automatically, and then saves it into a .csv\
          \ file. For this model training, I don't believe that I used the CoAID dataset\
          \ [2]; sorry for the confusion.</li>\n<li>For preprocessing the data, I\
          \ followed most of the steps in the Fine-Tuning a Pretrained Model tutorial\
          \ (<a href=\"https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter3/1?fw=pt\"\
          >https://huggingface.co/learn/nlp-course/chapter3/1?fw=pt</a>) on Hugging\
          \ Face. I also found the Text Classification tutorial to be very useful:\

          >https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/tasks/sequence_classification</a>.</li>\n\
          <li>From my knowledge, I believe that I used the default hyperparameters,\
          \ as I did not do any tuning. However, that would be beneficial to the model\
          \ to try out different hyperparameters!</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Please let me know\
