        html: '<p>Hello. I am using your model for my research, and I believe the
          KR-finbert model is a model that has been pre-trained on a Korean corpus
          and a finance-specific corpus in addition to the base BERT model. I have
          a few questions that I would like to ask:</p>

          <p>Regarding the pre-training of the model to align with the finance domain,
          it is mentioned that the "reports issued by securities analysts" are included
          in the training data. I''m curious about the period during which the data
          for these reports was collected.</p>

          <p>I''m also interested in knowing the timeframe for the collection of financial
          news data used in the pre-training of the model.</p>

          <p>Thank you.</p>
