      subject: 'Rename README.md to As AI technology continues to improve, it is expected
        to have a significant impact on the job market in the near future. While some
        jobs may become obsolete, new jobs will be created as well. Here are a few
        ways in which AI is likely to affect the job market:  Automation: As AI technology
        advances, it will become increasingly capable of performing tasks that were
        previously done by humans. This could lead to the automation of many jobs,
        particularly those that involve repetitive tasks, such as data entry, manufacturing,
        and customer service.  New job opportunities: While some jobs may be automated,
        new job opportunities are likely to arise in fields such as AI development,
        data analysis, and cybersecurity.  Reskilling and upskilling: As the nature
        of work changes, workers will need to adapt and acquire new skills. This may
        require reskilling and upskilling programs to help workers transition to new
        roles and industries.  Changes in work patterns: With the rise of remote work
        and the use of AI in the workplace, work patterns are likely to change. For
        example, workers may increasingly work from home, and work schedules may become
        more flexible.  In conclusion, while AI is likely to have a significant impact
        on the job market in the near future, it is important to note that it is not
        a one-size-fits-all scenario. The impact will vary depending on the industry
        and the nature of the work. However, it is likely that the job market will
        undergo significant changes in the years to come, and workers and businesses
        will need to adapt to stay competitive.'
