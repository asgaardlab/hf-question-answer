        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Every time I try to use the model I get the following error.</p>

          <p>RuntimeError: The size of tensor a (48) must match the size of tensor
          b (64) at non-singleton dimension 3</p>

          <p>It happens also on the huggingface page in the test section of the model
          page.</p>

          <p>I am new to ML, but to me it looks like internal problem that a model
          encounters when trying to parse the input I feed to it. This is an example
          string I use as input.</p>

          <p>a house with two bedrooms and three bathrooms</p>

          <p>I appreciate any ideas how one can fix this on the user side or any updates
          about possible fixes in the future =)</p>
