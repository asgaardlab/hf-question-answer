        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Thank you for the great work organizing and fine tuning the model =)</p>

          <p>I have a question regarding the layout data. What is the size of the
          canvas on which polygons are placed?<br>E.g. in such configuration</p>

          <p>[Layout] bathroom: (121,113)(91,113)(91,69)(121,69), bedroom: (165,84)(121,84)(121,40)(165,40),
          living_room: (135,172)(91,172)(91,113)(135,113), kitchen: (165,113)(121,113)(121,84)(165,84),
          bedroom: (121,216)(91,216)(91,172)(121,172)</p>

          <p>I assume each pair in the brackets is a X,Y coordinate. If that is so
          - what are the max X and Y? Thank you!</p>
