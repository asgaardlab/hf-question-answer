          <p>This is fairly odd to me since a solid 90% of disney princesses are,
          in fact, white. So having it fairly difficult to generate white princesses
          seems to mean a biased training/dataset, and as a result makes this model
          completely useless for people who want to create pictures similar to classic
          disney films. Nothing wrong with having multiple ethnicities represented,
          but it''s a bit absurd that when I enter "white princess", a large portion
          of my results are black princesses.</p>

          <p>Am I just missing a token/keyword?</p>
