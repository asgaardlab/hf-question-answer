        html: '<p>I''m using img2img, a picture of my fiance. I''m using the "classic
          disney style" in the prompt and it pretty much just spits out an image of
          the classic disney princess, it could be anybody. What I''m trying to do
          is create a version of her with the disney style but it doesn''t really
          look like her. How do you conform closer to the source image? </p>

          <p>Very cool models btw, not sure if you''re aware of this but you were
          given big props on the Corridor Crew YouTube channel where they used your
          model to create a really sick spider verse short. <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBWVHCYZ_Zs">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QBWVHCYZ_Zs</a></p>
