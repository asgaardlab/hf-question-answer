          been enjoying Analog Diffusion a lot, and made true gems with it. Will post
          them soon. I do have a huge manually curated glamour library of photos.
          Could we maybe work on this to even make more fine tuned models? Let me
          know how I could help you on that, I love what you did.</p>
