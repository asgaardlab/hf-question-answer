        html: '<p>I am looking to utilise this model as part of my research for a
          masters dissertation on quality estimation in MT.  However, I am not sure
          if this model is currently useable.  Firstly, although the language pair
          is Russian/English, the language pair in the example code is Romanian/English.  Testing
          in Russian and Romanian it seems to work with both although the range between
          completely accurate and completely inaccurate seems larger for Romanian
          (0.15) compared to Russia (0.05).  Any background you could share on this
          model would be greatly appreciated.  Many thanks, Rob</p>
