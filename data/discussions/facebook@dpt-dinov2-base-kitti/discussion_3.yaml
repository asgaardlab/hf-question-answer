        html: '<p>Hello,<br>Thank you for providing the code. Can you explain a bit
          about the difference between kitti and nyu versions?<br>Also, in DPT model
          the brighter areas show regions that are closer (less depth) but here I
          think it is the opposite. Right? </p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
