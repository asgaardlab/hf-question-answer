        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Yes adding Mask R-CNN and Cascade Mask R-CNN is on the roadmap. This
          particular model is still an experiment for this PR: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/18533">https://github.com/huggingface/transformers/pull/18533</a>.</p>

          <p>However first we''re in the process of adding the AutoBackbone API, which
          will allow to use frameworks like DETR and Mask R-CNN with any backbone,
          including ViT, Swin, ConvNext, etc.</p>

          <p>Stay tuned for that! For now I''d recommend using DETR, <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/conditional_detr">Conditional
          DETR</a> or <a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/model_doc/deformable_detr">Deformable
