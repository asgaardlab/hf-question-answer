          </blockquote>

          <p>You don''t have to take our word for it, just download Dolphin dataset
          and run awk search through all json files, ie:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>awk ''/openai.com/{ print $0 }'' flan1m-alpaca-uncensored-deduped.jsonl</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>You might find some references if you search specifically for "OpenAI":</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>awk ''/OpenAI/{ print $0 }'' flan1m-alpaca-uncensored-deduped.jsonl</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>..but nothing remotely similar to the example of OpenAI''s disclaimer
          above.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>Oh!  My bad.  I consider that a bug, for it to even have the word OpenAI
          in it.  I''ll clean it up</p>
