        html: '<p>Hey Undi95,</p>

          <p>thank you so much for yet another model brew. This one tastes different,
          and I have a lot of fun with it. In my opinion it is not so well suited
          for RP, since it would never just answer in short sentences. It pushes the
          story very far on each answer wich barely lets room for the user to interact.
          So this is annoying for a round based RP...</p>

          <p>BUT, when I am in a lazy mood and just want to enjoy a good story, this
          model right now is my number one choice. It''s amazing at storytelling.
          You can let it keep going and going and it''s really good at it. It even
          manages to continue more tricky scenarios pretty good. So, for just relaxing
          after work, this one is really great. It''s strength is, where other models
          are lacking, which is to not being dependent on much (or any) user input
          to write a good story. </p>

          <p>Nice!</p>

          <p>Greetings.</p>
