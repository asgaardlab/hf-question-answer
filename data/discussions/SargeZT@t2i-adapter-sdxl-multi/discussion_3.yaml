        html: '<p>So I''m working on a fun project for my friend and their kids. I
          want to take their colored drawings and turn them into amazing art that
          my friends can use during story time. Pretty simple using a GUI interface
          like invoke/comfyUI/automatic1111, but I wanted to challenge myself and
          write a super simple version of the full stack myself..</p>

          <p>I''ve already built a jupyter notebook that uses t2i-adapter-sketch-sdxl-1.0,
          and built a pipeline with an ensemble of expert denoisers to get a really
          good outcome. However, the problem is that the SDXL t2i adapter for sketch
          only takes in white on black pictures. The picture that the kids drew loose
          all their color. So I''ve been googling up and down trying to figure out
          how to train a model or how to modify the pipeline to be able to keep the
          color, until I ran into your models.</p>

          <p>So i wanted to ask for your guidance on what would be the best course
          of action to achieve best results for a combo of color+sketch when using
          SDXL and T2i adapters via python code.</p>
