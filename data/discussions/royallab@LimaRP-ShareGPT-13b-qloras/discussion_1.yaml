        html: '<p>Ahhh I don''t think this was explained properly. So, the experiment
          used the character names themselves as the <code>User</code> and <code>Character</code>
          roles. Here''s a sample prompt using the system prompt template you sent:</p>

          <pre><code>SYSTEM: Enter roleplay mode. You are currently having a conversation
          with User, whose traits are:

          &lt;SECOND PERSONA&gt;

          You are Character with the following persona:

          &lt;FIRST PERSONA&gt;

          Also, pay attention to this scenario:

          &lt;SCENARIO&gt;

          User: &lt;Add the first user message here&gt;

          Character:

          </code></pre>

          <p>Stuff enclosed in <code>%{}</code> was a random choice between given
          options. For example, <code>%{Red|Blue}</code> will either choose Red or
          Blue when creating the dataset from the python script linked in the model
          card.<br>&nbsp;<br>And yes, everything enclosed in angle brackets should
          be replaced with your own text. Another thing to note is that the system
          prompt changes depending on what lora was used (ex. prompt-a onechar), so
          be sure to look at those respective system prompts and adapt accordingly.</p>

          <p>I use this lora without instruct mode in SillyTavern, so I am not too
          familiar with instruct and system prompts, but this should work.</p>
