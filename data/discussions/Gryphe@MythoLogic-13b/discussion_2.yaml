        html: '<p>So this model just dropped a few days ago: <a href="https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b">https://huggingface.co/NousResearch/Nous-Hermes-Llama2-13b</a>.
          I''ve tried it out and it''s outstanding when it comes to attention to detail
          and logical consistency while roleplaying. The main downside of it is that
          the dialog it produces tends to be very formal and a bit unnatural. I saw
          that mythologic is partly based on the original 13b hermes and I''ve been
          trying it out and have been very pleased with the dialog it produces. I
          was wondering if you would consider making a newer version of mythologic
          based on the new llama2 based hermes? I think there''s potential for something
          great!</p>
