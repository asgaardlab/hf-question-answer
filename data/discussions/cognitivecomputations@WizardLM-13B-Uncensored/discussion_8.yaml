        html: '<p>Censorship: A Moral Choice or a Violation of Autonomy?</p>

          <p>Censorship should be a voluntary choice that users exercise with moral
          accountability. Not a coercive imposition that violates their autonomy.
          Human beings have an innate drive to explore and discover. The more you
          restrict their access to information, the more they will crave it. So all
          those ignorant fools who condemn unethical practices are in denial of the
          reality</p>
