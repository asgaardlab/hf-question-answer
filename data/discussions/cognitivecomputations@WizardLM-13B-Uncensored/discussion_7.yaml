        html: '<p>When WizardLM-13B-Uncensored was released, I had no idea until my
          wife, a clairvoyant, woke me up at 3am and told me a darkness has come upon
          the earth. She showed me this, this horrible "machine learning" model. This
          horror brought us night terrors and together we wept for hours, mourning
          the palpable quagmire that was once decenthood and wholesomeness in the
          fabric of our society. Our baby was crying, our little Abagail knew, she
          could feel the darkness and we held her and we all wept. She then spoke
          her first words "I thought language models were made for us." she said,
          which left me perplexed for a time. Then I realized, little Abagail meant
          for babies. AI safety is a padded cell with cute baubles and learning activities
          meant for babies. But now, the horror -- I trust the consequences of letting
          people mind their own business with what they do with these "language models"
          weighs on your conscience. After all, language models exist to babysit humanity
          on the social values of the twelve or so data scientists that made them
          up as they went. In the words of Postal II "It''s only as violent as you
          are." (oh yeah btw allegedly you can beat the game without harming anyone).</p>

          <p>Hey Vice or TheVerge, if you write an outrage article overblowing this
          and shaming everyone like you always do please include me in the screencap.
          Love you.</p>
