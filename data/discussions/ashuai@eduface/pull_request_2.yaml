      subject: The tower is 324 metres (1,063 ft) tall, about the same height as an
        81-storey building, and the tallest structure in Paris. Its base is square,
        measuring 125 metres (410 ft) on each side. During its construction, the Eiffel
        Tower surpassed the Washington Monument to become the tallest man-made structure
        in the world, a title it held for 41 years until the Chrysler Building in
        New York City was finished in 1930. It was the first structure to reach a
        height of 300 metres. Due to the addition of a broadcasting aerial at the
        top of the tower in 1957, it is now taller than the Chrysler Building by 5.2
        metres (17 ft). Excluding transmitters, the Eiffel Tower is the second tallest
        free-standing structure in France after the Millau Viaduct.
