        html: '<p>I hope you''re doing well. I was wondering if you could help me
          with a question I have regarding the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" and "whisper-large-v2-pt"
          models.</p>

          <p>I noticed that the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" model has a Wer of ''4.8385'',
          which is lower than the Wer of ''5.590'' achieved by the "whisper-large-v2-pt"
          model. Does this mean that the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" model has outperformed
          the "whisper-large-v2-pt" model?</p>

          <p>I bring this up because the "whisper-large-v2-pt" model is currently
          the best performing model in terms of evaluation, according to:<br><a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://paperswithcode.com/sota/automatic-speech-recognition-on-mozilla-67">https://paperswithcode.com/sota/automatic-speech-recognition-on-mozilla-67</a></p>

          <p>However, the "whisper-large-v2-pt-v3" model has a lower Wer score but
          is not ranked first. I would appreciate any insight you can offer to help
          me understand why this is the case.</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for your help.</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Lucas Rodrigues</p>
