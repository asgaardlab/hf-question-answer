        html: '<p>Hi,<br>I tried to install your model but it crashed my Spacy version
          (in the sense that I have to uninstall it and reinstall). I don''t know
          if the problem is with Spacy or with the new Python 3.6 (in fact with the
          latest py version there are problems with cuda and consequently with transformers)
          or both, but it would be great if your model could run also with more recent
          version of Spacy&amp;Py.  Do you plan to do so?</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
