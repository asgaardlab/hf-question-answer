        html: '<p>As it''s an Alpaca model, try this:</p>

          <pre><code>Below is an instruction that describes a task. Write a response
          that appropriately completes the request.


          ### Instruction:

          Prompt goes here


          ### Response:

          </code></pre>

          <p>I have two other 65B models you could try as well. For example gpt4-alpaca-lora_mlp
          is also trained on Alpaca, but using GPT4 responses instead of GPT3.5. So
          it''s generally higher quality.</p>

          <p>You''re right that a 65B should be pretty good at instructions. Even
          base Llama 65B can respond well to instructions when given a suitable prompt.  However
          as this has been fine tuned, it may be that it only responds well to the
          exact prompt template; so if you weren''t trying the above, it may work
          better if you do.</p>
