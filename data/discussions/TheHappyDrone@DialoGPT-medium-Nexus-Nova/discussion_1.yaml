        html: '<p>Happy to hear that! I am not sure how others train their DialoGPT
          models, but I personally went with an approach of making my own dataset
          from scratch with the help of ChatGPT to speed up the process. I made about
          1100 lines of dialogue back and forth between the potential "customer" and
          "salesman". I have 1000 lines of text only on the sale of ships and there
          is lots of repetition to try to get the AI to be consistent. I trained using
          the guide using collar <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/twewy-discord-chatbot">https://github.com/RuolinZheng08/twewy-discord-chatbot</a>.
          I think my settings were either 6 or 9 epochs, and self.per_gpu_train_batch_size
          = 1, self.per_gpu_eval_batch_size = 14. Don''t quote me on that though,
          could have been different.</p>

          <p>personally I was actually unhappy with the results so far but I am glad
          to hear you think otherwise. My main issue so far has been that the bot
          doesnt have the coherence I want it to. Moving around my prompts order in
          the training file might help with that, but I think it''s a limitation of
          this model overall that might not be able to be overcome. One second its
          talking about one ship, but then the next second I ask it for more info,
          it will sometimes mention an entirely different ship. This doesnt always
          happen, but it''s my biggest gripe with the model overall. I have been working
          on another version which broadens up the conversation topics away from ships.
          I might also try to train on the large model instead of medium, but havent
          had the time to compare pricing on cloud GPUs.</p>

          <p>Me and my friends are making a collaborative sci fi D&amp;D game where
          we all take turns DMing and I''ve created this bot as an experiment in creating
          NPCs that can talk on their own accord. My end goal is to place Nex and
          many others into my in universe codex system, which is basically our own
          in universe internet. This is still early days but for something I put together
          in under a day, im pretty happy with the progress</p>

          <p>I''ve added you on discord if you want to discuss further and share my
          training data: Fourth Dimension#3938<br>Thanks and have a great day</p>
