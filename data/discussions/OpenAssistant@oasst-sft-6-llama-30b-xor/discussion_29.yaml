        html: '<p>I tried the same problem, and it works the reason it , its not that
          advance to get to analyse the problem basically it can''t breakdown into
          simpler terms but that''s doesn''t mean it can''t solve, if you gave the
          same problem by breaking it down to an extent and then ask it to solve it
          will do. </p>

          <p>Bytheway i used chatGPT to breakdown the problem and then fed it to this
          model, so idea is if this model can breakdown problems into simple terms
          so we can achieve ChatGPT like responses. </p>
