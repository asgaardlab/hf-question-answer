          5, which is the HF LLaMA conversion script. I have the original LLaMA 30B

          <p>python src/transformers/models/llama/convert_llama_weights_to_hf.py --input_dir

          <p> However, after running the above line successfully as mentioned in Step
          5, nothing is saved in my output directory except an empty temporary folder.
          What should I do to ensure a successful conversion?</p>
