          It doesn''t matter for this purpose if the hash algorithm is secure or not.
          It is assumed you trust the source you got LLaMA from and trust this repository.
          The reason most are using md5 is because it''s fast and preinstalled on
          most Linux distributions as md5sum. sha256sum is preinstalled as well but
          it''s slower. Modern not widely adopted hash algorithms like blake3 are
          not preinstalled. It''s worth mentioning that md5 is only broken in the
          sense that an attacker can generate 2 documents with the same checksum but
          not in the sense that for a given document an attacker can create a different
          document with the same checksum. So md5 still secure for the purpose of
          preventing someone from replacing a file with a malicious one but I would
          not recommend ever using such a weak hash algorithm for this purpose.</p>
