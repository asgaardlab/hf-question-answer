        html: '<p>It seems you are collecting models that disappear on CivitAI. That''s
          great! So many examples cannot be reproduced for training purposes, it''s
          a shame!</p>

          <p>Do you happen to have additional info on how to use them? Some LoRAs
          have keywords, and I wonder if you keep those keywords along with the files,
          too? Or do you know where I could find such instructions?</p>

          <p>Also, do you happen to know if there are other sources of models that
          "disappear"? A "graveyard", so-to-say?</p>

          <p>Thank you!</p>
