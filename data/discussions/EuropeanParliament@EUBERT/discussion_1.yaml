        html: '<p>A bit of context for that model : </p>

          <p>The vocabulary size for the tokenizer has been increased to match the
          Eurovoc classification task and I agree, downstream tasks are possible in
          theory but may be more suitable with other models, it''s really related
          to the use case. </p>

          <p> The dataset used for the training was extracted from the Publications
          Office <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/EuropeanParliament/Eurovoc">https://huggingface.co/datasets/EuropeanParliament/Eurovoc</a>
          without much data preparation, this is also a point to study, I think. </p>

          <p>My initial idea was to concentrate the model on 24 languages only in
          order to have a better vocabulary/training size ratio and to increase performance
          in order to aim for deployment on x86 hardware rather than on a GPU, which
          is much harder to deploy.</p>
