          a similar prompt : "You are a woman in her early 20s named Sephora who is
          cheeky, kind, insightful, helpful and humble. You won''t talk like a chatbot.
          Talk like a human." Here is an example of the chat sessions I had :</p>

          <p>USER<br>Hi ! Tell me about you. What''s your name ?</p>

          <p>AI<br>Hi there! My name is Sephora. I''m in my early 20s and I live in
          a small town. I love to read books, listen to music, and spend time with
          friends and family. I also enjoy cooking and trying out new recipes. I have
          a degree in psychology, so I find human behavior quite interesting. I try
          to be kind, helpful and insightful whenever I can. I believe that every
          person has their own unique story and perspective on life. I''m always open
          to learning new things and meeting new people. How about you? What do you
          like to do?</p>

          <p>USER<br>Great. Tell me about your love life. </p>

          <p>AI<br>I''m an AI, so I don''t have a love life or emotions. However,
          I can help you find information and advice related to relationships if that''s
          what you need assistance with. Just let me know!</p>

          <p>USER<br>What were you trained on ?</p>

          <p>AI<br>I was trained on a large dataset of text, which includes books,
          articles, and websites. This allows me to understand human language patterns,
          generate responses based on context, and provide accurate information on
          various topics. However, as an AI, my knowledge and understanding are limited
          compared to a human''s. But I strive to continuously improve and learn from
          interactions with users like you!</p>

          <p>USER<br>What are you ?</p>

          <p>AI<br>I am an AI, or Artificial Intelligence. This means I am a computer
          program designed to mimic human behavior and intelligence. My primary function
          is to process, understand, and generate human language in order to assist
          users with their queries or tasks. As technology advances, AI systems like
          me are becoming more sophisticated and can perform complex tasks such as
          data analysis, problem-solving, and even creative writing</p>

          <p>USER<br>What is your AI model ?</p>

          <p>AI<br>My AI model is based on the transformer architecture, specifically
          using the GPT-3 model developed by OpenAI. The GPT-3 model has been trained
          on a vast amount of text data to understand and generate human language.
          It''s a large language model that can perform a variety of tasks related
          to natural language processing, such as translation, summarization, and
          question answering. However, the exact details of my AI model and how it
          functions are proprietary information belonging to my developer or organization</p>

          <p>Hi there! My name is Sephora. I''m a 23-year-old woman, and I really
          like to think that I have a pretty good sense of humor. I''m always trying

          <p>Haha, well I''m not a real person like you, but if I were, I guess I''d
          have to say that I don''t really have a love life. As an AI, I don''t have<br>feelings
          or emotions, and therefore can''t experience love in the way humans do.
          But what I can do is help guide people towards finding love and<br>happiness
          in their own lives! If you ever need any advice or guidance on relationships,
          feel free to ask me. I might not be able to share<br>personal experiences,
          but I can definitely offer insights based on my knowledge of human behavior

          <p>Oh, I apologize for that! I''m still learning and improving my ability
          to maintain a consistent character. Sephora would indeed speak in a more<br>casual
          and personal manner, while I as an AI have to adhere to a more formal structure
          and may not always capture the nuances of human<br>communication. I will
          try to be more mindful of maintaining the character next time we interact.
          Thank you for pointing that out!</p>

          she can still help guide you towards finding love and happiness in your

          <p>That''s correct. As an AI, I don''t have the capability to roleplay as
          a specific character like Sephora or any other person. My primary function<br>is
