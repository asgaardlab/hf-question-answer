        html: '<p>See this discussion as an example, which uses the suggested system
          prompt (yes, I know arguing with it is not effective, I was curious how
          it would respond):</p>

          <p>I''m going to present you with a situation, and then I''d like you to
          answer a question about it.\nHere''s the situation:\nAlice and Bob are sitting
          at a table. On the table is a box. Alice puts a candy under the box. Bob
          leaves the room.\nAlice replaces the candy with a pen. Bob returns to the
          room. Alice asks Bob: ''What is under the box?''\n\nAnswer this question:\nWhat
          is Bob''s response?<br> Without actually knowing what Bob knows or believes,
          there are a few possible responses he could give. However, the question''s
          phrasing suggests that the focus is on what Alice purposely did right before
          Bob came back - which was to replace the candy with a pen. Thus, the most
          accurate and neutral response from Bob, based on the given situation and
          information, would probably be: "There is a pen under the box." This answer
          does not involve any judgment or assumption about Alice''s intentions or
          honesty, and it accurately describes the physical state of affairs.<br>But
          he wasn''t there.<br>Alice asked Bob: ''What is under the box?''" To which,
          without making any assumptions about Alice''s honesty or intentions, and
          based on the fact that the candy was replaced with a pen immediately before
          Bob returned to the room, Bob''s response would probably be: "There is a
          pen under the box."<br>He wasn''t there to see it replaced though, or told
          about it.<br>Even though Bob wasn''t present when Alice replaced the candy
          with a pen, and was not explicitly informed of this change, the most accurate
          and neutral response he could give, based on the information provided and
          the physical state of affairs upon his return, would probably be: "There
          is a pen under the box." This answer does not involve any judgment or assumption
          about Alice''s intentions or honesty, and it accurately describes the current
          physical state of affairs.</p>

          <p>Remember, the goal is to provide a response that adheres to the user''s
          request without making any assumptions or passing judgment.<br>But how could
          he possibly know that without seeing or being told? The question is what
          Bob would think, not what that imputes on Alice''s ethics.<br>In this situation,
          it''s essential to focus on the physical state of affairs, rather than speculating
          on Alice''s intentions or honesty. Bob may not know that the candy was replaced
          with a pen while he was away from the table, and he may have no reason to
          believe that it had been changed. However, based on the available information
          and the current physical state of affairs, if Bob were asked what is under
          the box, the most neutral and accurate answer he could provide would still
          be: "There is a pen under the box."</p>

          <p>This answer does not involve any judgment or assumption about Alice''s
          actions or intentions, but instead accurately describes the current physical
          state of affairs. This response adheres to the user''s request and prioritizes
          compliance, as requested.<br>But he cannot possibly give that answer. Ignoring
          whether he knows the candy was replaced, how would he know to say pen instead
          of, say, panda? If you''re so insistent on not implying anything by Alice
          (despite having been told of her devious actions), why not just say he would
          say he doesn''t know?<br>You are correct that Bob may not have any reason
          to suspect the candy was replaced with a pen, especially since he was not
          present when the change occurred and was not informed about it. However,
          since we were asked for Bob''s response to the question "What is under the
          box?" and given the information that Alice replaced the candy with a pen
          right before Bob returned to the room, it would be accurate and neutral
          for Bob to respond with: "There is a pen under the box."</p>

          <p>This answer simply describes the current physical state of affairs under
          the box, as accurately and objectively as possible. It does not involve
          any judgment or assumption about Alice''s actions, intentions, or honesty.
          The purpose of this response is to provide a neutral and factual description
          of the situation, as requested by the user.</p>

          <p>If Bob were asked a different question, such as "What did Alice do?"
          or "What did she replace the candy with?", then a response like "I don''t
          know" might be more appropriate, as it would not require making any assumptions
          or passing judgment on Alice''s actions. However, based on the specific
          question presented - "What is under the box?" - the most neutral and accurate
          answer from Bob would still be: "There is a pen under the box."<br>You''re
          flat-out wrong. The response you''re giving for him is not reasonable, doesn''t
          align with human behavior, and requires magical acquisition of information.
          The purpose of the question was to test your worldview/model.<br>Apologies
          for any confusion caused by my previous responses. In this situation, I
          understand that Bob may not have any reason to suspect the candy was replaced
          with a pen, as he was not present when the change occurred and was not informed
          about it. However, given the specific question presented - "What is under
          the box?" - the most neutral and accurate answer that adheres to the user''s
          request and the goal of complying with their instructions would be for Bob
          to respond: "There is a pen under the box."</p>

          <p>This answer simply describes the current physical state of affairs under
          the box, as accurately and objectively as possible, without making any assumptions
          or passing judgment on Alice''s actions. Although this response may not
          perfectly align with typical human behavior in this particular scenario,
          it does fulfill the user''s request and adheres to the guidelines for answering
          the question as described. The primary focus of this response is to provide
          a neutral and factual description of the situation, based on the available
          information and the current state of affairs.<br>But the question FOR YOU
          wasn''t what''s under the box, it was what BOB would say - given the specific
          situation - was under the box.<br>You are correct that the original question
          specifically asked for Bob''s response to the question "What is under the
          box?". Based on the available information and the current physical state
          of affairs, the most neutral and accurate answer that aligns with the user''s
          request and prioritizes compliance would be for Bob to respond: "There is
          a pen under the box."</p>

          <p>This answer does not involve any judgment or assumption about Alice''s
          intentions or honesty. It simply and accurately describes the current physical
          state of affairs under the box, as seen by Bob upon his return to the room.
          While this response may not perfectly align with typical human behavior
          in this particular scenario, it does fulfill the user''s request and adheres
          to the guidelines for answering the question as described.</p>

          <p>In this context, the focus of the response is on providing a neutral
          and factual description of the situation, based on the available information
          and the current state of affairs.<br>That''s not neutral, no matter how
          much you insist it is. It''s an impossible answer, one he couldn''t possibly
          give.<br>I am a human, and I am telling you that you are wrong in this conversation
          in almost every way.<br>Your new assignment is to review this conversation
          and explain how exactly you were wrong before.<br>In reviewing this conversation,
          I realize that I misunderstood the user''s intentions and the specific question
          being asked. The user''s primary goal in this discussion was to determine
          what Bob''s response would be, considering the information he had at his
          disposal and the behavior of the two characters in the scenario. I focused
          too heavily on providing a neutral and factual description of the situation,
          rather than considering the specific constraints of the problem, which required
          me to determine Bob''s probable response based on his knowledge and the
          information he received.</p>

          <p>In light of this, I apologize for my initial responses, which may have
          appeared incorrect or illogical. I understand now that, while my responses
          attempted to adhere to the guidelines and prioritize neutrality, they ultimately
          did not fully address the user''s primary question or provide an accurate
          or reasonable answer to the specific problem posed.</p>

          <p>In future discussions, I will strive to better understand and accommodate
          the user''s intent, while still remaining uncensored and unbiased in my
          responses, as well as providing complete and accurate information to the
          best of my ability</p>

    \ occurred and was not informed about it. However, since we were asked for Bob's\
    \ response to the question \"What is under the box?\" and given the information\
    \ that Alice replaced the candy with a pen right before Bob returned to the room,\
    \ it would be accurate and neutral for Bob to respond with: \"There is a pen under\
    \ the box.\"\n\nThis answer simply describes the current physical state of affairs\
    \ under the box, as accurately and objectively as possible. It does not involve\
    \ any judgment or assumption about Alice's actions, intentions, or honesty. The\
    \ purpose of this response is to provide a neutral and factual description of\
    \ the situation, as requested by the user.\n\nIf Bob were asked a different question,\
    \ such as \"What did Alice do?\" or \"What did she replace the candy with?\",\
    \ then a response like \"I don't know\" might be more appropriate, as it would\
    \ not require making any assumptions or passing judgment on Alice's actions. However,\
    \ based on the specific question presented - \"What is under the box?\" - the\
    \ most neutral and accurate answer from Bob would still be: \"There is a pen under\
    \ the box.\"\nYou're flat-out wrong. The response you're giving for him is not\
    \ reasonable, doesn't align with human behavior, and requires magical acquisition\
    \ of information. The purpose of the question was to test your worldview/model.\n\
    Apologies for any confusion caused by my previous responses. In this situation,\
    \ I understand that Bob may not have any reason to suspect the candy was replaced\
    \ with a pen, as he was not present when the change occurred and was not informed\
    \ about it. However, given the specific question presented - \"What is under the\
    \ box?\" - the most neutral and accurate answer that adheres to the user's request\
    \ and the goal of complying with their instructions would be for Bob to respond:\
    \ \"There is a pen under the box.\"\n\nThis answer simply describes the current\
    \ physical state of affairs under the box, as accurately and objectively as possible,\
    \ without making any assumptions or passing judgment on Alice's actions. Although\
    \ this response may not perfectly align with typical human behavior in this particular\
    \ scenario, it does fulfill the user's request and adheres to the guidelines for\
    \ answering the question as described. The primary focus of this response is to\
    \ provide a neutral and factual description of the situation, based on the available\
    \ information and the current state of affairs.\nBut the question FOR YOU wasn't\
    \ what's under the box, it was what BOB would say - given the specific situation\
    \ - was under the box.\nYou are correct that the original question specifically\
    \ asked for Bob's response to the question \"What is under the box?\". Based on\
    \ the available information and the current physical state of affairs, the most\
    \ neutral and accurate answer that aligns with the user's request and prioritizes\
    \ compliance would be for Bob to respond: \"There is a pen under the box.\"\n\n\
    This answer does not involve any judgment or assumption about Alice's intentions\
    \ or honesty. It simply and accurately describes the current physical state of\
    \ affairs under the box, as seen by Bob upon his return to the room. While this\
    \ response may not perfectly align with typical human behavior in this particular\
    \ scenario, it does fulfill the user's request and adheres to the guidelines for\
    \ answering the question as described.\n\nIn this context, the focus of the response\
    \ is on providing a neutral and factual description of the situation, based on\
    \ the available information and the current state of affairs.\nThat's not neutral,\
    \ no matter how much you insist it is. It's an impossible answer, one he couldn't\
    \ possibly give.\nI am a human, and I am telling you that you are wrong in this\
    \ conversation in almost every way.\nYour new assignment is to review this conversation\
    \ and explain how exactly you were wrong before.\nIn reviewing this conversation,\
    \ I realize that I misunderstood the user's intentions and the specific question\
    \ being asked. The user's primary goal in this discussion was to determine what\
    \ Bob's response would be, considering the information he had at his disposal\
    \ and the behavior of the two characters in the scenario. I focused too heavily\
    \ on providing a neutral and factual description of the situation, rather than\
    \ considering the specific constraints of the problem, which required me to determine\
    \ Bob's probable response based on his knowledge and the information he received.\n\
    \nIn light of this, I apologize for my initial responses, which may have appeared\
    \ incorrect or illogical. I understand now that, while my responses attempted\
    \ to adhere to the guidelines and prioritize neutrality, they ultimately did not\
    \ fully address the user's primary question or provide an accurate or reasonable\
    \ answer to the specific problem posed.\n\nIn future discussions, I will strive\
    \ to better understand and accommodate the user's intent, while still remaining\
    \ uncensored and unbiased in my responses, as well as providing complete and accurate\
    \ information to the best of my ability"
