        html: '<p>Naa its fine you can leave this up i make them to be used and shared
          by everyone :). I use Automatic1111 Webui with the dream booth extension
          and usually have around 300 pictures and set on the dream booth concepts
          tab the dataset directory of all the images instance prompt of [filewords]
          which grabs all the tags from the .txt file associated with the image which
          are acquired by using my own python scripts to scrap the tag+image of danbooru
          though you can use a new program call (Danbooru downloader) which is probably
          easier never tried it. i dont set any class image stuff. for general setting
          i set the raining steps per image (Epochs) to 200 which will train each
          image 200 times which would be 200 * 300 images so 60,000 steps which will
          take about 6 ish hours on a 3080 ti 12GB VRAM which you will need a card
          with a decent amount of VRAM. everything else i keep default and in the
          end i usually merg the RAW model back into anythingV3 at 15% anythingv3
          and 85% new model to get cleaner faces and a sharper image. Hope you make
          some cool models</p>
