          are not compatible between 1.5 and XL. Is it like: generate XL -> encode
          into 1.5 latent -> upscale with 1.5 model + tile controlnet? Are the results
          close to the original XL image with denoise 0.3 - 0.4?


          I do pretty much that, but I do get some small "artifacts" on my images
          - 1.5 model doesn''t understand things XL created. I made DA post with my
          results:

          https://www.deviantart.com/yashamon/journal/Testing-out-AI-upscaling-methods-983456810

          Sometimes I even get whole scenes in a single tile that somewhat match original.
          For example check out roof of this one:

          StableSwarmUI. The StabilityAI are doing an excellent job with this interface

          even without Tile. When they launch Tile, I will use it in this interface,

          <p>Isn''t it still the same "simple" upscale we have everywhere else, just
          with another UI? Personally I stopped using a1111 when I learned about Comfy,
          more flexibility but still clumsy at many things (in terms of UX). You piques
          my interest with StableSwarmUI, checked the latest version, still alpha,
          but in their motivation doc (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/blob/master/docs/Motivations.md">https://github.com/Stability-AI/StableSwarmUI/blob/master/docs/Motivations.md</a>)
          two things are interesting: 1) non-Python server (they use C#) and they
          also use Comfy in the backend (not sure if it''s good or bad), 2) custom
          frontend (no dependency on another tools).</p>

          <p>How would you compare it to Comfy, if you''ve used the latter? And just
          to avoid too much off topic, have you tried upscaling the same image in
          StableSwarmUI and any other tool with the same parameters, do you get different
          results (with better in StableSwarmUI)?</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>Exactly. As you mentioned, it uses Comfy on the backend. This is good
          because it''s like using all the power of Comfy in a simple and friendly
          interface. If you already use Comfy, you can simply link it with the StableSwarm
          interface and you''re ready to go. You can use your Comfy workflows directly
          in the interface if you wish.</p>

          <p>I''m getting very good results upscaling 2x with denoising from 0.2 up
          to 0.5 on some images. It uses less GPU because with an RTX 2060s, it''s
          taking 35sec to generate 1024x1024px, and it''s taking 160sec to generate
          images up to 2048x2048px. This is interesting because it only upscales in
          one step, without having to take it to Img2Img.</p>

          <p>To do this, use the "Refiner" tab. In "Refine Control Percentage" it
          is equivalent to the Denoising Strength. In "Refiner Method" I am using:
          PostApply. In "Refiner Upscale Method" I chose to use the model: 4x-UltraSharp.pth
          </p>

          <p>When they launch the Tile model, it can be used normally in the ControlNet
          tab. I have already tested ControlNets for SD1.5 and it is working normally.</p>

          <p>And it would be even better with tile model. I am upscaling my images
          to 8K at 0.15-0.2 denoise (with higher I get a lot of "artifacts"), and
          if I want god results I have to make it in steps (1536x864-&gt;1920x1080-&gt;3840x2160-&gt;7680x4320)
          and often have to fix minor issues manually. Also some areas (when you zoom
          in) are blurry and some are too sharp. With tile model I assume I could
          do in in one go and 0.8 denoise, which removes a lot of manual work.</p>

          <p>Example:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63a0ccdfb5515dccd418e6cb/SgDXgyn-nBQpO2RQiO-_x.jpeg"><img

          '
        raw: '> This image was generated in the JuggernautXL (SDXL) model and was
          upscaled to 2x without Tile and 0.5 denoising strength. You can see that
          there is still enough detail in this image to be considered a good detailed
          high quality image. Using a good UI and knowing how to configure it, it
          is now possible to get good 2x upscaled images, even better than SD1.5 with
          Tile.


          And it would be even better with tile model. I am upscaling my images to
          8K at 0.15-0.2 denoise (with higher I get a lot of "artifacts"), and if
          I want god results I have to make it in steps (1536x864->1920x1080->3840x2160->7680x4320)
          and often have to fix minor issues manually. Also some areas (when you zoom
          in) are blurry and some are too sharp. With tile model I assume I could
          do in in one go and 0.8 denoise, which removes a lot of manual work.
