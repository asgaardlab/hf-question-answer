        html: '<p>Hello Sayantan Dasgupta,</p>

          <p>I''m a student trying to reproduce the results of the task specific distillation
          of TinyBert for SST2. I use the general distilled model from HuggingFace
          (Acc 58% on SST as per the glue script). But when I perform the intermediate
          and prediction layer distillations, the accuracy drops to 50%.<br>I use
          the Fine tuned BERT from <a href="https://huggingface.co/JeremiahZ/bert-base-uncased-sst2">https://huggingface.co/JeremiahZ/bert-base-uncased-sst2</a>  (accuracy
          ~92%) and the training commands as per the TinyBERT repository. Are there
          any differences in the training pipeline of your models like the use of
          a learning rate scheduler or a better BERT model to distill from?</p>

          <p>Any advice would be very helpful. </p>

          <p>Best,<br>Dipti</p>
