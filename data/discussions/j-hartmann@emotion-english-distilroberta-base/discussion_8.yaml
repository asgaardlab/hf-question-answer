        html: '<p>Hello, I''m looking for a model that can provide some dimensionality
          for each emotion (e.g., fear on a scale from 1-5). I''m wondering if the
          probabilities for each emotion could be interpreted as a dimensional score
          (e.g., joy = .98, sad = .41). Is that possible? If not, is there a way to
          fine-tune the model to accommodate this? Thank you very much!</p>
