        html: '<p>I am getting the following error -<br>TypeError: _batch_encode_plus()
          got an unexpected keyword argument ''boxes''<br>when trying to encode the
          dataset using following command-<br>encoding = processor( words, boxes=boxes,
          word_labels=word_labels,<br>                             truncation=True,
          padding="max_length")</p>

          <p>I have created a pipeline which works with lilt-roberta-base model and
          was trying to use the same pipeline with the lilt-xlm-roberta-base model.
          Ideally shouldn''t the same code for nielsr/lilt-xlm-roberta-base and SCUT-DLVCLab/lilt-roberta-en-base.
          My understanding is we have removed the roberta-base with the xlm-roberta.
          But still shouldn''t the model use bounding boxes for processing.</p>

          <p>Am I missing anything? </p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
