        html: '<p>Just wanted to give you a shout-out for creating an awesome model!
          Your expertise and hard work are truly impressive, and your model has made
          a significant impact in the field of generative AI.</p>

          <p>I''m writing to ask if you''ve considered releasing the model under an
          open-source license? I think it would be great to make the model available
          to more people for research and development purposes. Also, I''m interested
          in using the model for commercial purposes, so I''d like to request permission
          for that as well.</p>

          <p>I understand that you may have your reasons for not releasing the model
          under an open-source license, but I hope you''ll consider the potential
          benefits of doing so. Thanks again for your contribution to the field of
          machine learning, and I''m looking forward to hearing back from you soon!</p>
