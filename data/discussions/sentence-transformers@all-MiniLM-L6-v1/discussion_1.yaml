        html: '<p>I am wondering if anyone has considered how to adapt this model
          so that it represents the embedding of a sentence not as a vector but as
          a statistical distribution, perhaps a multivariate normal distribution with
          a diagonal covariance matrix. See <a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623">https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.6623</a>.
          Something more sophisticated would be even better. Either way, a distributional
          embedding would provide some quantification as to the possible meanings
          a passage of text might have.  </p>

          <p>Also, I appreciate that this is likely not the best place to post this
          more conceptual question. But I like this small model. If anyone has suggestions
          on a better forum, please advise.</p>

title: Adapting this model so that it produces a statistical distribution rather than
  a vector-valued embedding?
