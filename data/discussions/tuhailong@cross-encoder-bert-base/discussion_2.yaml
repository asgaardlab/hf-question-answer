          While one use CECorrelationEvaluator, two use CERerankingEvaluator.<br>
          I want use cross encoder to ranking the search items, which way should i
          use. From word meaning i think reranking maybe more suitable. But it''s
          label only has 0/1. correlation''s label could be number represent the relevance
          between query and doc.</p>
