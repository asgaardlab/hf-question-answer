          \ This wouldn't be necessary if I could set headers for each file.</li>\n\
          <li>Custom subdomain (like <code>my-cool-space.rocca.huggingface.co</code>)\
          \ so that <code>localStorage</code> and stuff like that are isolated per\
          \ app. Currently github has the equivalent of <code>rocca.huggingface.co/my-cool-space</code>\
          \ (i.e. subdomain per <em>account</em>, not per <em>space</em>), which isn't\
          \ good enough because <code>localStorage</code> can then conflict between\
          \ apps (which can be a security issue, beyond just a cause of bugs). Actually,\
          \ looking at a space now, it looks like spaces are served from <code>hf.space/embed/rocca/my-cool-space</code>?\
          \ If so, and if <code>localStorage</code>/<code>IndexedDB</code>/etc. are\
          \ enabled by the iframe, then that could be a significant security issue\
          \ - private data from all apps could be exfiltrated by getting the user\
          \ to simply click a link to a malicious Space.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>All that\
          \ said, what browser ML people like myself need most right now is for ML\
          \ frameworks and tools to have web bindings/converters. It's often not that\
          \ much extra work to add JS bindings to ML tools, thanks to how mature the\
          \ Wasm ecosystem is becoming. For example, <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://github.com/huggingface/tokenizers/issues/935#issuecomment-1147809992\"\
          >we've been working on getting tokenizers</a> working in the browser, and\

          <p>Anyway, thanks for your interest in this work. With WebGPU likely releasing\
