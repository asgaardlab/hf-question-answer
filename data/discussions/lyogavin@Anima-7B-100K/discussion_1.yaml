          <p>Since I only found 7B 100k models, I am assuming evaluation above was
          done between 7B models and Claude2. I bet Claude2 could be some over 200B
          MoE monster model to obey the scaling law of emergence. If 7B 100K model
          is that good, I cannot wait to see what you guys can achieve with bigger
          models.</p>

          <p>If QLoRA a 7B models only requires 800MB, the fined-tuned 70B-100K model
          should on it''s way. I guess?</p>
