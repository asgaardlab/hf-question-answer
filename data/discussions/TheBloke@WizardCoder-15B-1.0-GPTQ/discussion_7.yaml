        html: '<p>Can you quantize the rwkv-4-raven model in GPTQ since ggml has already
          been done? Id prefer the 14b is you can only do 1, and if you can do it
          in 8-bit that would be lovely, but i will take a 4-bit version too. but
          if you can do all the models that would be awesome too as im sure other
          people would like them. Its a really good coding model that supports 8k
          context out of the box and follows instructions better than wizard coder
          (at least thats what ive heard)</p>
