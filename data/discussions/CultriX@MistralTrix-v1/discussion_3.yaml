          <p>I''m working on a dataset, myself. Going to set it up in ChatML format
          it will be made up of books, movies, and video game mechanics in order to
          train a text based virtual reality simulation of the best characters and
          environments. Almost finished adding lord of the rings to it now...feel
          free to comment on my profile what titles you''d like me to add to the knowledge
          base</p>
