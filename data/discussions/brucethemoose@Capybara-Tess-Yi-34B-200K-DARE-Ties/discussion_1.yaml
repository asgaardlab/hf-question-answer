          <p>The merge is not straightforward, some of the model weights get trimmed...
          Hence I suspect this won''t repeat since 1.2 was only merged in at ~1/5
          weight with less density. I was already thinking I would remerge with just
          1.3 if it repeats like Tess 1.2, or maybe turn the density way down.</p>
