        html: '<p>so if I got it right, to load this model in 8 bit I would first
          need to load it on my ram in its 32bit version (and this is even more difficult
          because the model is just dumped in a unique 44 Gigs file) and then quantize
          it...?</p>

          <p>could we maybe get a sharded, 16 bit version of this thing?<br>I''ve
          been getting very interesting results with the xl version of this but can''t
          seem to scale to the xxl in any easy way according to the resources I own</p>
