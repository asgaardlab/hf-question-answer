        html: '<p>Hello! I found this model by chance on the AI HUB discord and was
          really bummed out to find out, that the EN models were deleted. I was going
          to try and play around with trying to use some PGR char voices for personal
          use and was wondering whether it is possible to use them with your permission,
          and if there is any way to recover them! I think your models are very good
          quality, and I''d be very interested in getting to use the EN models over
          the JP ones.<br>Thank you either way :)</p>
