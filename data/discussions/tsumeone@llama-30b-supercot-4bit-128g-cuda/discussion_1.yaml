        html: '<p>I wonder if u know that this is the best model right now ?? this
          little boy of 30B''s codes better than GPT4..<br>CoT has always been the
          secret.. SuperCoT has a real difference. We need to get metrics of this
          and larger context.. potentially looking at a gamechanger dataset "SuperCoT".
          Gonna try to FT something smaller and see what comes out..<br>Looking forward
          for a 4k, 8k ctx models!! </p>

          <p>Great work bro, u need to work on the README and bring more data on this,
          very very promising.</p>

          <p>All I did was quantize a LoRA merge someone else made, I didn''t do anything
          with training the LoRA used to make this. That link above is the SuperCOT
          LoRA which is responsible for how this model performs. Their readme has
          more information on what''s included and how it was made.</p>
