        html: '<p>Dear Elad, I appreciate your reaching out and sharing the results
          of the model-recycling project conducted by your team at IBM. It was really
          neat to find out that the FlanT5 model variant that I''d trained for a somewhat
          toy task of generating podcast summaries for my employer''s podcast was
          such a performant model in your ''backtesting'' of various NLP model families.</p>

          <p>I''m eager to see how the upcoming versions of my model will perform
          in your evaluations, and I hope that more organizations will undertake large-scale
          assessments of model families. These comprehensive analyses not only help
          identify exceptional multitask learners and foundational models but also
          uncover valuable datasets, such as the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://paperswithcode.com/dataset/samsum-corpus">SAMSum
          Corpus</a> dataset from Samsung Research and the <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/salesforce/booksum">Salesforce
          Booksum</a> dataset. The latter, in particular, showcases the invaluable
          contributions made by Drago Radev and other NLP scholars with a classical
          background. </p>

          <p>Thank you once again for your recognition and engagement in the ever-evolving
          field of natural language processing, understanding, and generation. If
          there are any follow-up studies that the <code>model-recycling</code> team
          is engaging on do reach out.</p>
