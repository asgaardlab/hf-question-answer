        html: '<p>I noticed the name of the project is "falcon-7b-alibi". I was intrigued
          by the possibility of integrating Alibi technology into the falcon-7b language
          model. As the name suggests, Alibi technology has the potential to significantly
          enhance the context length or token limit of large language models. I wanted
          to reach out to seek confirmation and further details about this integration.</p>

          <p>To clarify, could you please confirm whether the "falcon-7b-alibi" project
          incorporates Alibi technology? If so, I would greatly appreciate it if you
          could provide information on the extent to which the context length has
          been increased in the falcon-7b model.</p>

          <p>Understanding the increased context length in falcon-7b would be beneficial
          for my research/work, as it could potentially improve the model''s performance
          on tasks requiring longer contextual understanding.</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for your time and attention to this matter. I look
          forward to hearing from you soon.</p>
