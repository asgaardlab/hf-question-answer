        html: '<p>Please add model_type to the config as DeciLM has now done. Unfortunately
          this changes the model type from <code>deci_lm</code> to <code>deci</code>

          a PR there to change this but that means either one of those will not work
          there, so for future I would support the explicitly set <code>"model_type":
