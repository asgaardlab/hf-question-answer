        html: '<p>Might be an easier way to do everything I''m doing with this, but
          I work in photoshop all day and have a passion for actions, so I made one
          to help my workflow with this model, thought I would share it! </p>

          <p>Super simple action, creates guides based on rows and columns (so it
          will work no matter what scale your image is, as long as its an 8x8,) creates
          slices based on the guides, and then exports (Save for web legacy) each
          slice as an individual image.<br>You''ll likely have to update the file
          path for the export step, but once that is done, you can<br>File &gt; Automate
          &gt; Batch<br>the action directed at a folder full of 8x8s, and it will
          slice and export them all in a sequential order.</p>

          <p>Then you can import them as an image sequence into premiere pro or whatever
          other editor you use. </p>

          <p>I''m also enhancing resolution inside Bridge''s Camera Raw tool, I haven''t
          gotten good results using codeformer on these types of images myself yet.  </p>

          <p>And here''s a link to a test video I made with the model, came out suuuuper
          weird and visceral, not at all what my prompt was aimed at, but still wild
          looking.</p>

          animations but i managed to get some results from heavily describing the
          subject and adding a lot of weights to it. Just need to experiment a little,
          maybe even try merging with another model too.</p>
