        html: '<p>I have a similar question, but I know how to train embeddings with
          automatic1111. Instead, what is your suggestion of source images if I wanted
          to create a TI that would place the main content of a SD generation inside
          of a mock-up ? For instance, a generation of "a pixar style cat" inside
          of a blank canvas hanging on a wall.  How might the training images have
          to be structured so that it can generate the main content inside of a mockup?
          Your training gave me the idea that this should be possible.   Thank you
          in advanced for any feedback!</p>
