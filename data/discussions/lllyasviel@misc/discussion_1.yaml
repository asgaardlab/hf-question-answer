        html: '<p>Dear Lllyasviel/Lvmin,</p>

          <p>The Fooocus project is so great and I love it so much.</p>

          <p>Well...I met a little problem: always failed when updating to newest
          version.  the progress would fail at 20% or 30% every time..<br>Even if
          I tried to download these files on hf directly, failed too..</p>

          <p>Would you like to upload these files to the github project?<br>It''s
          really hard to download big files in China  T T</p>

          <p>Thank you so much for Fooocus and Controlnet!</p>
