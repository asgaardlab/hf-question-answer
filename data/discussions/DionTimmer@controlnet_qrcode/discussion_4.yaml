          <p>Thank you for sharing this great work. Could you tell me how you get
          ''a large dataset of 150,000 QR code + QR code artwork couples''? Could
          you show us some paired examples from this dataset? </p>

          <p>Thank you for your help.</p>

          <p>Best Wishes,</p>
