        html: '<p>How can this checkpoint be used.</p>

          <p>I would like to try this model out.</p>

          <p>I have tried:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>OFA github page but there is no demo on how to use a model for Visual
          Entailment</li>

          <li>OFA-Sys/ofa-sys documentation but it also lacks info for VE (VQA is
          well explained however)</li>

          <li>huggingface to find other VE models</li>

          <li>huggingface documentation to see if something is done for VE tasks but
          couldn''t find anything</li>

          </ul>
