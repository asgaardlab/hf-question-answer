        html: '<p>Thanks for sharing this model!</p>

          <p>I have two quick questions as below. It would be very appreciated if
          you could answer:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Was the model trained from scratch or fine-tuned?</li>

          <li>Just wanted to confirm that if the model was trained w/ the train split
          only while evaluated on the test split?</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Sincerely,<br>Jaejin Cho</p>
