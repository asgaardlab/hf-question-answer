          <pre><code>This new file is equivalent to `pytorch_model.bin` but safe in
          the sense that

          no arbitrary code can be put into it.


          These files also happen to load much faster than their pytorch counterpart:

          https://colab.research.google.com/github/huggingface/notebooks/blob/main/safetensors_doc/en/speed.ipynb


          The widgets on your model page will run using this model even if this is
          not merged

          making sure the file actually works.


          Feel free to ignore this PR.
