          comment</a>:</p>

          <p>I used <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/ShivamShrirao/diffusers/">this
          repository</a>, and mostly followed <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7bVZDeGPv6I">these
          instructions</a>.<br>But in the concepts JSON each concept''s <code>instance_prompt</code>
          matches <code>class_prompt</code> (e.g. both are <code>"clone wars style"</code>,
          <code>"anakin skywalker"</code>, etc.) and <code>instance_data_dir</code>
          matches <code>class_data_dir</code>.  20 images per concept.<br>Actually,
          regularization images weren''t used at all. But I wanted more images for
          style,  so I split style images to different directories, so there are 10
          concepts with same <code>"clone wars style"</code> but different directories.</p>

          <p>Then, the model was trained with these parameters: </p>

          <pre><code>learning_rate=1e-6

          lr_scheduler="polynomial"

          max_train_steps=20000

          </code></pre>

          <p>And the results were fine, but I continued training with <code>learning_rate=1e-7</code>
          and <code>lr_scheduler="constant"</code> for 20-k more steps. You should
          save each N-k steps, check for results and choose the best.</p>
