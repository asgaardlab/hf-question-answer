        html: '<p>I tried training with a script taken from the AutoGPTQ repository
          (examples/peft/peft_adaption_prompt_clm_instruction_tuning.py) and got the
          adapter, but no matter how I tried I couldn''t get it to merge into one
          model or at least get it to work together. I would really appreciate any
          help, I''m only posting here because I''m getting quite desperate.  I tried
          following the guide from your answer <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-65B-GPTQ/discussions/2">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/guanaco-65B-GPTQ/discussions/2</a>
          but it didn''t work, I also tried running the base model through AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized
          but then it didn''t work to combine it with the adapter, in general I would
          really appreciate your help, I''ve been struggling with this for 2-3 days

          <p>I have not yet tried AutoGPTQ PEFT training.  But oobabooga''s text-generation-webui

          <p>No, you can''t combine a GPTQ model with another model.   Your options
          are:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Download Meta llama 2 7B HF, run a standard PEFT LoRA training on it,
          merge the adapter with the base model to produce a new fp16 model, then
          either run that fp16 model in 4bit with <code>load_in_4bit</code>, or GPTQ
          it</li>

          <li>Download Meta llama 2 7B HF, run a 4bit QLoRA training on it, then merge
          + quantise as described in 1.</li>
