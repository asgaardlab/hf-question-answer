        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I was trying out your model with SQL Server schema. I have a huge number
          of tables which was far exceeding the token length of the model. May I ask
          how the connector works and whether we can just write our own connector
          and integrate with the scripts you provided in the github repo?</p>

          <p>Thank You!</p>
