        html: '<p>Hey, great work! I love your mission of bringing LLMs to the GPU-poor
          but CPU-rich masses. I am on a similar mission: I would like to use your
          bge models in with transformers.js in <a rel="nofollow" href="https://do-me.github.io/SemanticFinder/">SemanticFinder</a>
          but I currently cannot load them due to the following missing files:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>special_tokens_map.json</li>

          <li>vocab.txt</li>

          <li>tokenizer_config.json</li>

          </ul>

          <p>(also missing in sparse version)<br>Could you please add them? </p>

          <p>Also, would you mind tagging all your onnx models with transformers.js
          too? I''m periodically mining all feature-extraction models so it would
          be cool if your models would then land in my data dump automatically. :)
