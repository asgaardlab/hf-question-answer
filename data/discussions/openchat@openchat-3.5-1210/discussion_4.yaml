          <p>I''m interested in using OpenChat 3.5 for commercial applications, given
          its Apache 2.0 license.<br>However, I''ve observed that previous versions
          of OpenChat were developed on the Llama2 framework.</p>

          <p>Does OpenChat 3.5 also rely on the Llama2 base?<br>Additionally, does
          the training mentioned on the model''s page refer primarily to fine-tuning?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for your answer </p>
