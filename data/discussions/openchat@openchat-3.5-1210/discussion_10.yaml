          The conversation goes quite well. Some impressions:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Performance on Chinese is really bad.</li>

          <li>Strong context understanding, such as correcting math results, step
          by step analysis of quick sort, etc.</li>

          <li>Generate plausible information from time to time, for example, <strong>insisting</strong>
          a famous programmer to be of Geman desent in several round of conversations,
          in which case even a (fake) Youtube link is given as a reference.</li>

          </ol>
