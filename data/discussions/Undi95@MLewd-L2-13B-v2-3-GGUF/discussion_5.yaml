          It''s even better then the later merges like CoT, Chat-1, Chat2, so far.
          I too had some huge problems in the beginning but they all just boiled down
          to MLewd being very sensitive with repetition penalties. It works better
          without mirostat to my experience. The trick is: Put repetition penalty
          not higher than 1.09. This, by the way, is mandatory for each model based
          on Mythomax, and set repetition penalty range to 2048. Oh, and don''t set
          temperature too high. values between 0.8 and 1.0 are doing great. With those
          settings it has been the most stable llama-2 model I''ve tested so far.
          Oh, I run it on KoboldCPP by the way, without using any rope settings of
          course.</p>
