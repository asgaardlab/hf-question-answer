        html: '<p>Hi,<br>I tried this model in SillyTavern, using KoboldCPP. The output
          is horribly gibberish, and I hope you can help me. I''ve noticed the same
          problem with other Mythomax merges also. While spoken text is always clear
          and in good english, descriptive text is just a gibberish sequence of words
          without any grammar, pronouns, articles and so on. </p>

          <p>Example:<br>"Kurumi winks impudently upon overhearing request looking
          sideways sizing opportunity opening up possibly turning conversation towards
          different course entirely changing potential outcome destined way events
          might unfold hereafter should someone answer open ended questions asked
          unable otherwise understand subtle intricacies complex world surrounding
          him presently explore deeper inner reaches mind searching secrets hidden
          behind closed doors masking true emotions buried deep past layers long forgotten
          only fragments found amidst haze mist obscuring realities blurring distinction
          fiction fantasy."</p>

          <p>Edit: It seems like Mythomax reacts different to rep. penalty settings
          then other models, actually wiping out every repetitive word, like articles.
          Lowering the penalty reduces the effect gradually. It''s a pretty decent
          model, once the obstacles are removed. </p>

          <p>I highly recommend to try out the mancer setting suggestions for Mythomax:

          Using those settings, the MLewd models run beautiful, highly intelligent
