        html: '<p>Hello, when the prompts are post-fixed with "painting" the image
          generated has all 4 sides with black and/or white outlines. The model shows
          the image like it is a real painting with white, or black, or wooden outlines,  or
          it is shown drawn in paper in front of a wall like it is a real painting.
          </p>

          <p>That did happen a week ago but it was unusual , now almost every picture
          is drawn outlined. Has the model changed in some ways the last few days,
          or is it my faulty assumption that it didn''t happen so regularly? </p>

        html: '<p>Actually the images i generated i post-fixed them with "surrealistic
          abstract triangleism abstract cubism painting " and that prompt seems to
          affected the most. Just post-fixing with "painting" is ok.  I created already
          some very good images which can be found here, <a rel="nofollow" href="https://abstractpancubism.substack.com/archive">https://abstractpancubism.substack.com/archive</a>   but
          now all the images with that prompt generated are outlined with other stuff.  </p>
