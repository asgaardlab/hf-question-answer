        html: '<p>Hi there, </p>

          <p>I have read on a few different forums, threads, and reddit posts that
          Vicuna models need to be prompted in a specific way. Some examples I''ve
          seen are: </p>

          <p>Option 1: </p>

          <pre><code>USER: What is 4x8?

          ASSISTANT:

          </code></pre>

          <p>Option 2: </p>

          <pre><code>A chat between a human and an assistant.


          ### Human:

          &lt;Question&gt;

          ### Assistant:

          &lt;Answer&gt;

          </code></pre>

          <p>Can someone help with what the prompt format for this model should be
          and if we were to change "Human" or "Assistant" to alternative names to
          whatever a user sets them to be (i.e. user''s name is Jane and they want
          to call the assistant Doe) will that invalidate the format of the prompts?</p>

          <p>Customization: If you wish to personalize the interaction, such as changing

          <p>Hello AI, You are running on a personal computer, and your name is "Doe."
          Act as if you''re an individual, always be helpful to the human. In this

          considering factors like seed and temperature settings. Therefore, after
          any changes or updates, it''s advisable to double-check the prompt format
          to ensure the AI understands your instructions correctly. You can manually
          change the seed until you get an working one and use that seed always, As
