        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>I''ve been using this Wizard-Vicuna uncensored model in Instruct mode,
          specifically with the Vicuna 1.1 template. However, I''ve noticed that even
          after trying other templates (and other modes, like chat), the results don''t
          seem to be better than the censored one, which gives me absolutely better
          responses, especially with coding tasks. One of many issues I''m facing
          is that the generated code responses, especially in Python, are not properly
          indented and I can''t find a way to make it identing it.<br>If may be useful,
          I''m running it with groupsize set to 128, model type llama and wbits=4.</p>

          <p>Has anyone else encountered these problems? I read everywhere that this
          uncensored model is way better than the censored one, but unfortunately
          I could not see it so far.</p>

          <p>Thank you!</p>
