          3B model has potential, the Zephyr model is outstanding for a 3B model but
          its not that good for Roleplay, I think Zephyr + Aesir + toxicQA dataset
          could make a good model! OpenHermes may also be good at increasing model
          intelligence.Thank you for all of your work. </p>
