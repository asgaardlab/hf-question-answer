        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>We have release our data for long instruction following, LongAlpaca-12k,
          and the update models, LongAlpaca-7B/13B/70B. They are available in the
          following links. These models should be much better than the original SFT
          models. We use the alpaca prompt format it is more general than what we
          used previously.</p>
