        html: '<p>I am wondering if it is possible to use this model to input several
          images into the processor and ask the model to compare between the two charts?  Or
          potentially to even combine the data from the two charts and overlay them
          onto a new chart? </p>

          <p>E.g.: I want to compare the GDP growth of India and China over the last
          20 years and have two graphs for the GDP for each country. Then I want to
          generate a new chart (or the code for it at least) where both of them are
          on the same chart and to answer the question which one grew faster.</p>
