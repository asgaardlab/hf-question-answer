        html: '<p>Hi there , first i congratulate you all on the amazing work you
          are doing within this org, i''am a huge fan since 2021 and always waiting
          for new releases from your Lab.<br>i''am working this year on my undergrad
          thesis and we want the outcome of this project to be an LLM for Arabic using
          fine-tuning instead of training from scratch. I believe you have been doing
          pretty much same sometimes and i''m interested to know the cost of such
          fine-tuning processes, of course i''am aware that the cost is related to
          many factors (model size, dataset size, hardware etc) but would love to
          hear an estimation for a specific case and then i believe i can adapt it
          to my configuration in order to have an estimated cost.<br>Hope to hear
          from you soon</p>
