        html: '<p>Hi, big fan of this model!</p>

          <p>Would love to be able to apply this style directly to an image.<br>When
          using img2img, it always seems to step far away from the original image
          before the redshift style is in place?</p>

          <p>ONNX is mentioned in the docs, maybe it is possible to make something
          like <a href="https://huggingface.co/spaces/sayakpaul/cartoonizer-demo-onnx">this</a>
          one, but with redshift style?</p>
