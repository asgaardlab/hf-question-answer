          <p>This appears to have been resolved for whisper-medium ( <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium/discussions/12">https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-medium/discussions/12</a>
          ) but was never applied to this model.</p>

          <p>My apologies if I am missing something, these models are all very new
          to me. Please let me know if I am presenting this incorrectly.</p>
