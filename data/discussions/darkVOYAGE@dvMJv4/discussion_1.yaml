          <p>Hey, so most of the portraits shared a similar prompt structure to the
          following, which I kept as simple as possible to let the MJ tuned model
          do it''s thing: </p>

          <p>"dvMJv4, ---&gt;describe the person you want&lt;---, 85mm, close up,
          portrait, telephoto"</p>

          <p>Here''s the one you quoted above: </p>

          <p>Positive prompt:<br>"dvMJv4 style, lifeguard, 85mm, portrait, close up,
          telephoto"</p>

          <p>Negative prompt:<br>blurry, soft, undeveloped, low quality, text, watermark,
          signature, pink, purple, mask </p>

          <p>And here''s a few others: </p>

          <p>"dvMJv4 style, beautiful african woman, 85mm, close up, portrait, telephoto"</p>

          <p>"dvMJv4 style, attractive future native american, 85mm, portrait, close
          up, telephoto"</p>

          <p>"dvMJv4 style, mad scientist, 85mm, portrait, close up, telephoto"</p>

          <p>Haha I have no idea honestly, I only input the simple prompt above and
          SD did the rest. I think it''s because the images that I tuned the model
          on had a lot of sci-fi/random/ornate clothing, so that style carries through
          on the rendered images without needing to input too many specific descriptor
          words. To me that''s part of the fun appeal of models like this is that
          you can get a lot of chaotic / unexpected styling.</p>
