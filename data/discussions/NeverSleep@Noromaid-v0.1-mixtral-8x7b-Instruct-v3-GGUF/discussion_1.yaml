          <p>I am using the Q5_K_M version and this model is doing extremely good
          with low context, but it repeat itself more and more as context gets closer
          and closer to 6k tokens. And when it reaches this limit it starts repeating
          itself a lot, even when it''s out of context (it copy pastes the previous
          responses even when it doesn''t relate to the last input), and it''s no
          longer creative.</p>

          <p>Even with a repetition penalty of 1.5, I cannot get rid of the repetitions.</p>

          <p>Is this a problem of Mixtral models in general?</p>
