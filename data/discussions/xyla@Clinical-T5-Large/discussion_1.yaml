          which is restricted behind a data-use agreement, as well as some sensitivity
          training. It''s unlikely that we are going to release the model to the general
          public anytime soon, as we haven''t done any "leakage" testing. More specifically,
          we are worried that the model might generate text directly from a clinical
          note, which would definitely not be good! We need to do a bit more research
          in order to be confident that it''s difficult to extract sensitive patient
