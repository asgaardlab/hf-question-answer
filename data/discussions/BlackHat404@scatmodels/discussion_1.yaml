          <p>That''s fantastic news! I don''t currently know anything about lora creation,
          but I''m happy to contribute in any way I can, if you need extra source
          material, extra processing power, etc.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>Thanks for the offer but at this time the only thing that would help
          is if my job stopped demanding I show up in person twice a week for the
          whole day lol. </p>
