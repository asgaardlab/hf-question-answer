        html: '<p>I will respectfully decline, that''s one of the few things I just
          don''t see the appeal of. I can point you toward some resources if you want
          to try your hand at it though. Here is the guide I learned from <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://civitai.com/models/22530">https://civitai.com/models/22530</a>.
          Assuming you have access to google collab this is free and I feel the instructions
          are mostly clear. I''ve used it for all my stuff until very recently so
          if I was going to a reprimand for the content I feel like it would have
          a happened by now.</p>
