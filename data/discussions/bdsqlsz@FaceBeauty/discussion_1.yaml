        html: '<p>Hello bdsqlsz,<br>This is Eric Maeng, Co-founder at Studio Peekaboo</p>

          <p>First of all, I appreciate your contribution toward SD scripts. We were
          so much inspired by kohya scripts.<br>At Studio peekaboo, we make AI-generated
          studio headshots to 600 ~ 1000 Korean female users a day. Customers love
          the photo-realistic quality. Yet making headshots is not our end goal.</p>

          <p>We aim to replace the camera. We envision a future where people upload
          pictures of their lives on instagram all generated or modified with super
          personalized models.</p>

          <p>Our recent challenge lies in super resemblance and avoiding deformed
          hands/eyes. I''d love to discuss our challenges with you and let you hear
          our vision toward super personalized models. Also I want to hear your view
          on training model and pre/after processing for our purpose</p>

          <p>Let me know if you are interested.<br>You can check our web service here
