        html: '<p>i am not into programming i dont know what is the use of these datasets.
          but i have a simple question can i use your dataset or script to make the
          clash of clans strategies. like if i show a base design to your dataset
          than it will help me to tell me what army i should choose to attack on a
          base and from where to start an attack to make data attack a 3 star attack.
          like for example i am sharing a picture of a base of town hall 9 i am not
          owner of this base i have downloaded this base from <a rel="nofollow" href="https://cocbases.net/th9-war-base/">https://cocbases.net/th9-war-base/</a>
          i just wanna know that are they really sharing the real bases because they
          claim that their bases are anti 3 star and anti eveything.<br><a rel="nofollow"

          alt="good level 9 war design anti everything.jpg" src="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/652fb5ae9d798c41a3714104/ule7ShrRTAu1QQb48UxNp.jpeg"></a></p>

          <p> one more thing is your database will help me to design anti 1 star clash
          of clans bases? if these 2 things will happen than it will be awesome. </p>
