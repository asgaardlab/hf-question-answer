          <p>Shouldn''t it be better to just finetune base SOLAR? I mean it''s not
          just a normal Mistral frankenmerge, it''s also further pretrained with 3T
          tokens. While this one have the same concept but with much fewer training
          data?</p>

          <p>Yeah no, it''s not solar. Undi is doing experiments here, wanted to see
