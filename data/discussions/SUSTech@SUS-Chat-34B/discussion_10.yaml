          Thank you for replying. I have used the code provided in the SusTech/ Sus-Chat''s
          Model Card. When I run the same prompt in the UI, the accuracy of the output
          is 95% but when ran locally is 75%. I think the main problem is related
          to the chat template function. What should I need to make changes in this
          code to fix this issue?</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
