        html: '<p>Hi ! </p>

          <p>I''m very interested by this project since Whisper''s albanian version
          is not very good when I tried it a few months ago. I would like to use it
          for personal cases, especially movie subtitles in Albanian, since there
          are amazing old movies but do not have subtitles, so I can''t understand
          everything.</p>

          <p>I tried using this model locally as well as online, and I can''t get
          past the following error:<br>"niv-al/peshperima-large-v2-merged does not
          appear to have a file named preprocessor_config.json. Checkout ''<a href="https://huggingface.co/niv-al/peshperima-large-v2-merged/1f7abb4ad5cb5abd0162c4cc1b1d7fde5cdbcc2e''">https://huggingface.co/niv-al/peshperima-large-v2-merged/1f7abb4ad5cb5abd0162c4cc1b1d7fde5cdbcc2e''</a>
          for available files."</p>

          <p>It seems that I can''t make it work without the preprocessor_config.json
          file which I couldn''t find anywhere. Could you please help me with that
          ? And if I''m not doing things properly, could you maybe provide me some
          direction or documentation ? :)</p>

          <p>Awesome project and thanks for your work !</p>
