        html: '<p>I can''t find the Github link claimed in the paper. Do the authors
          plan to release the code?</p>

          <p>In addition, is there any plan to release the (completion-based and token-probability-based)
          prompts used in the evaluation? The description in Appendix 6.2.1 isn''t
          clear to me. How is the "300-word long chunk" used in Figure 11? What''s
          meant by " followed by a list of hand-curated examples"? Do you need to
          manually write examples to show how to create prompts based on the 300-word
          original text chunk?</p>
