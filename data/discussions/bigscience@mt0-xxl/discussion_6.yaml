          <ol>

          <li>Yes LoRA works. I would try them for your tasks first though, maybe
          no further fine-tuning is needed</li>

          <li>You can fit mt0-xxl into that much with quantization / low-precision.
          Else mt0-xl is also good.</li>

          <li>No recom. here - many things are possible.</li>

          </ol>
