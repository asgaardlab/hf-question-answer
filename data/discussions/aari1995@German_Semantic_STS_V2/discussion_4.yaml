          <p>If I wanted to adapt this to a special domain, like German medical texts,

        html: '<p>Hi,<br>thanks!<br>Depending on the task. For semantic similarity

          consider adding tokens for example for special words before finetuning.

          also fine-tune on STS to prime the model on the task. First one would be
