        html: '<p>Damn Undi, you''re a machine! I''m Chasm on Discord, mostly the
          KoboldAI room think I may have seen you there - just got my feet wet with
          the Mistral series and have merge strategies mapped out for testing. My
          stubbornness drives me to desire creating something not seen yet and you''re
          five steps ahead. AKA I love your work.</p>

          <p>16% of the models I have in my merge arsenal are ones you made (wasn''t
          kidding; 42 models/adapters and did the math). Happy to see awesome things
          done in the merge space for real. It''s been amazing seeing this scene blow
          up the way it has. Would be enthusiastic to share notes; I feel safe in
          my bet that model merging is the way open source can outpace closed source
          models.</p>

          <p>And to keep this on topic - I''m adding Toppy to my arsenal and look
          forward to using it.</p>
