        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for creating and uploading this model on model hub. It is being
          extremely useful for me. I want to train this model on the dataset specific
          to my task. For this, I was going through the HF tutorial for Fine tuning
          a pre-trained model(<a href="https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training">https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/training</a>).
          </p>

          <p>The example showed in this tutorial is using HF dataset which is already
          present in a fixed format whereas my data having a text column and in another
          column its key phrases/keywords for training. Also the Fine tune example
          showed in tutorial is for classification model whereas this model is key
          phrase extraction model. My confusion is, do I need to use the same format
          which is given in HF fine tuning tutorial to train this model on my data
          or do I need to pass the data in some different way in this model. Because
          the model showed in HF tutorial to fine tune a model is a classification
          model so it contains one text column and one label column. But in my case
          I have text column and its key phrase column for each row of text. Does
          that means that I need to feed my dataset with just two columns only, one
          with text and another one is with key phrase column instead of label column
          as showed in the HF tutorial for classification model. Please guide.</p>

          <p>Please find the screenshot of the HF tutorial attached which I am referring
          to put my data for training.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1663058764020-63203b9c260e691cfc19eb76.png"><img

          <p>Please guide me how can I use this model to train it on my data. Thank
          you.</p>
