          <p>If we do not set the device in the pipeline we first get this warning:</p>

          <pre><code>UserWarning: You are calling .generate() with the `input_ids`
          being on a device type different than your model''s device. `input_ids`
          is on cpu, whereas the model is on cuda. You may experience unexpected behaviors
          or slower generation. Please make sure that you have put `input_ids` to
          the correct device by calling for example input_ids = input_ids.to(''cuda'')
          before running `.generate()`.

          </code></pre>

          <p>After that we get the error:</p>

          <pre><code>RuntimeError: Expected all tensors to be on the same device,
          but found at least two devices, cuda:0 and cpu! (when checking argument
