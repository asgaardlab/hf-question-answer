        html: '<p>Hi TIIUAE Falcon team, thanks for sharing this smaller model - we
          just did a finetuning for RAG instructions - and got really good results.   (Note:
          we released a few weeks ago, but there was a minor bug in the original testing
          script, and once corrected, the Falcon model really shined!) - check out
          the repo - <a href="https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-falcon-1b-0.1">https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-falcon-1b-0.1</a>
