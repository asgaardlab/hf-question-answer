    Can''t explain why it''s so short, expanding token size making it worse.

    I recommend using "simple-1" preset, on "divine intellect" it''s getting broken
    and produce very huge hallucinations like illogical or portions of programming
    code, etc.

    Talking with it mostly reminds interrogation session, preferred to use only short
    phrases. Sometimes it''s getting into self-repeating cycle after long topic discussion,
    this can be removed by slightly different questioning.
