    \ of checkpoints but it isn't pushed to hup with others files and when session\
    \ disconnected can't save it \nso when i  use .(/whisper-small-Arabic-aar/checkpoint-500)\
    \ in another session it give me error  .\n\nhow can  I get checkpoints folders\
    \ ? should i download the best  manually on my local device? and upload it to\
    \ model when i open another session ?"
