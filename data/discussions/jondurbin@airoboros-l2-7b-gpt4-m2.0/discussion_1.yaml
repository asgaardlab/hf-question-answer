          I keep encountering CUDA out-of-memory errors.

          Recently, I ran into a mysterious "Magic no. error."


          What I''ve Tried So Far:

          Where I Need Help:


          Understanding the Problem: Can someone help me break down these CUDA out-of-memory
          errors and the "Magic no. error"?


          Optimizing ''config.json'': I experimented, but maybe there are better settings
