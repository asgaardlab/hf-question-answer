        html: '<p>i finally can test the model for loss when extending context. It''s
          like the superhot lora didn''t take.</p>

          <p>Normal PTB should be smaller than that. And I did RP with it for a while.
          It has trouble to play characters and not just itself. It''s not bad to
          talk to and it writes so long. It''s just inherently flawed I think. On
          longer context after a while it got very repetitive. With compressed pos
          emb of 4 it actually started gibberish. Tests show why.</p>
