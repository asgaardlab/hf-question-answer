        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I was recently browsing nlln models on HuggingFace and I came across
          this model: "uer/t5-v1_1-base-chinese-cluecorpussmall". I noticed a discrepancy
          that I''d like to bring to your attention.</p>

          <p>According to the model''s name, it''s supposed to be a NLLB model. However,
          in the config.json file, the model_type and architecture are labeled as
          ''mt5'', not ''t5''.</p>

          <p>Here are the pertinent details:<br>Model name: uer/t5-v1_1-base-chinese-cluecorpussmall<br>model_type
          in config.json: <em>mt5</em><br>architectures in config.json: <em>MT5ForConditionalGeneration</em></p>

          <p>I noticed that Hugging Face does provide a label for T5 models. This
          discrepancy could potentially lead to confusion when users are trying to
          understand the underlying architecture of this model.</p>

          <p>I wanted to bring this to your attention in case it was an oversight.
          If it''s not an oversight and there''s a specific reason for this labeling,
          I''d appreciate it if you could clarify.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your time and the work you''ve put into developing this
          model. I look forward to your response.</p>
