        html: '<p>Hello ToolBench Community,</p>

          <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out with a suggestion
          that could significantly improve the accessibility of the ToolLLaMA-2-7b-v2
          model for a broader audience. As it stands, running such large models requires
          high-spec hardware, which may not be accessible to all users.</p>

          <p>To address this, I propose sharding the ToolLLaMA-2-7b-v2 model. Sharding
          would allow users with lower-spec PCs to run the model by dividing it into
          smaller, more manageable pieces that could be processed in parallel or sequentially
          with less strain on their systems.</p>

          <p>Moreover, considering the growing popularity of cloud-based platforms
          like Google Colab and Kaggle, which provide limited but free access to powerful
          computational resources, model sharding could also enhance the user experience
          on these platforms. Users could leverage the distributed nature of sharded
          models to run experiments and larger workloads without encountering resource
          limitations that often come with free tiers.</p>

          <p>By enabling model sharding, we could democratize access to state-of-the-art
          models, foster greater experimentation, and inclusivity within the community.</p>

          <p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this proposal or any alternative
          solutions that could facilitate running large models on less powerful machines
          or within the resource constraints of popular cloud services.</p>

          <p>Thank you for considering this enhancement.</p>
