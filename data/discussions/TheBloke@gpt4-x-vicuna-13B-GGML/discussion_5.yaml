        html: '<p>q5_K_M is the new "k-quant" format. It''s generally considered a
          better format. It will have slightly better accuracy, and likely higher
          performance as well. And it offers a wide range of size choices, so you
          can pick the one that best fits your hardware and gives you the ideal compromise
          between accuracy and speed.</p>

          <p>I may stop releasing the ''old'' quant formats (q4_0, q4_1, q5_0, q5_1
          and q8_0) sometime soon.</p>

          <p> But TLDR there''s not a <em>huge</em> difference between those two,
          so don''t sweat the choice. But generally I''d recommend q5_K_M or q6_K
          over q5_1 now.</p>
