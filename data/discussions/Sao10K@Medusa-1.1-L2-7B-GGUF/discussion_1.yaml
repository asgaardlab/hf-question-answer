        html: '<p>So not sure if you wanted feedback, but I found this surprisingly
          coherent story context following for a 7b model. Insistingly poetic/romantic
          prose in a sort of GPTish fashion (I imagine there''s some amount of synthetic
          datasets in here for sure), reverting to love and soppy metaphors - which
          I don''t think is ideal, but seemed to follow story context better than
          mythologic mini or even stable beluga 7b. </p>

          <p>Only tested a dozen gens or so though, but even that left an impression.
          13B models are pretty noisy often, let alone 7b models. This was pretty
          bang on.  Like it really seemed to ''understand'' what was going on. Unfortunately
          it''s prose tends to be ultra-romantic/soppy, even moreso than GPT itself.
          It''s like the ultimate romance model lol. </p>
