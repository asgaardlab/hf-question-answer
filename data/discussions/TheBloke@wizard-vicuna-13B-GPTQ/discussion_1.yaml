          this is not the case.


          I am curious how 30B will perform compared with 13B tho.'

  content: 'I suspect the larger the size, the more money it costs to train.  Further
    to that, perhaps it is much harder for folks like me to train and run inference.  I
    think if we can solve the training and inference issue with large model, say we
    can do all with runpod cheaply, then the next logical thing is to raise money
    through some kind of patreon campaign to raise money for producing it.  I believe
    someone has to pay the bill some how. Please correct me if this is not the case.
