          <p>I''m having a problem running almost every model now. I''m using the
          Colab notebook I have always used with success in the past (with good performances
          too), which is this one (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/github/pcrii/Philo-Colab-Collection/blob/main/4bit_TextGen_Gdrive.ipynb">https://colab.research.google.com/github/pcrii/Philo-Colab-Collection/blob/main/4bit_TextGen_Gdrive.ipynb</a>).</p>

          <p>Now all the models became very slow, almost unusable. Could you tell
          me if you have an updated Colab to refer to?</p>

          <p>The issue is that recent versions of text-generation-webui now use AutoGPTQ,
          and with the old notebook you''re using AutoGPTQ doesn''t get compiled.
          So it is doing inference on the CPU, which is horribly slow. The above notebook
          should solve that issue.</p>
