        html: '<p>It''s unavailable because this is a quantised GPTQ model and Hugging
          Face doesn''t support live inference on those.</p>

          <p>But I have an unquantised version uploaded as well, and inference is
          enabled on this: <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizard-vicuna-13B-HF">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizard-vicuna-13B-HF</a></p>

          <p>Personally I''ve never found that live inference demo to be any good
          though, because it only returns about 10 tokens which isn''t nearly enough
          to test anything useful.  But it''s available at the above link if you want
          it.</p>
