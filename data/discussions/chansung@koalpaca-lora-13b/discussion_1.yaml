        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>could you please guide me on how can I load this model on my computer(locally)
          to test how it works? I don''t want to train it, I just want to use your
          trained weight if it''s possible.<br>I have been trying to get it to work
          on my machine, but I am running into some issues and could use some guidance.</p>

          <p>I tried to use the pipeline, or even using torch and load_state_dict,
          but none of them worked for me to load this model on my system</p>

          <p>could you please provide some guidance on how to get your model up and
          running?</p>

          <p>Thank you so much for your time and expertise. </p>
