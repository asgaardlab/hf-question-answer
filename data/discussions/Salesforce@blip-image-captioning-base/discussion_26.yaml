        html: '<p>Hi All,</p>

          <p>I have this model deployed in multiple endpoints. Each endpoint is built
          has its own model.tar.gz file , but they all are built using the same base
          repo. When I try to generate the image embeddings for these endpoints, I
          would expect same embedding values generated when I pass the same image
          to these endpoints.<br>But instead I am seeing a difference in the values
          generated.</p>

          <p>Anybody else face this issue?</p>

title: getting different embedding values for the same image when trying to generate
  embeddings from two different sagemaker instances of the same model.
