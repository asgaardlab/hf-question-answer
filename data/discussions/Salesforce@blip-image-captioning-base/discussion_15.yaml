        html: '<p>Hi! In the model card, it is specified that this model is pre-trained
          on COCO, but I don''t see this configuration in the official repo:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/62d011476a61a88ea0d16665/WG9PVpMgMyCpehxi7WXft.png"><img

          <p>The pre-trained checkpoints are computed on a 14M images dataset (according
          to the paper made of images from COCO, VG, and Conceptual Captions), or
          on a 129M images dataset (previous dataset + LAION).</p>

          <p>Is the HF checkpoint a new configuration computed only on COCO, or is
          it one of the fine-tuned checkpoints?</p>

          <p>Thank you for the amazing work.</p>
