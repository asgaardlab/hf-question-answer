        html: '<p>I''m a total noob, I want to run this model on my 24Gb 3090, is
          this possible? i use the Text generation web UI but it fails to load. And
          it is hard for me to find a kind of manual explaining how to load models.
          It is like I am missing something and every one else knows how to use these
          models and how to load them. is there documentation somewhere? what am I
          missing? Also I would like to run it using command line but for now the
          Text generation web UI has my preference... Thanks for any help !!!</p>
