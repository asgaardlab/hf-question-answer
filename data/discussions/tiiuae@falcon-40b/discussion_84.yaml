        html: '<p>I really like Falcon 40B, it runs at 20 tokens/sec on a single 4090
          and has quality that appears to trump llama 65B or is at least at eye level
          while consuming a fraction of the KV-memory.<br>That said will there be
          updates ? New variants, fresh training updates to stay up to date ?<br>Or
          is this a one-time project, in that case Falcon won''t fly for long which
          would be such a shame for the time and energy you invested in the first
          place.</p>

          <p>Would be awesome to get a short response from TII/devs if there is a
          future or if this is the end of the road for now </p>
