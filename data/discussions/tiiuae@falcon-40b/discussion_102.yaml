        html: '<p>I would like to do some research and apply a single prompt to each
          entry in a text column in a dataset and then collect the results into a
          new column.</p>

          <p>I played with the 7B model in Databricks and entered a list of 80 prompts
          as my first test. It took a few hours to finish. I''m thinking that running
          the 40B model on a larger cluster is only going to get slower and slower.</p>

          <p>What is the recommended optimal procedure here? What kind of time/results
          can I expect in the best case?</p>
