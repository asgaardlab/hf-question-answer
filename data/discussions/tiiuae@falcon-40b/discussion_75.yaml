        html: '<p>I am relatively new to the topic of integrating RAG with Falcon.
          If anyone has practical experience working with RAG and Falcon, I would
          love to hear about your firsthand experiences, challenges you encountered,
          and any lessons learned along the way. I''ve been exploring Falcon and attempting
          to integrate RAG, but I''m encountering some errors in the process.</p>

          <p>My aim is to utilize my own knowledge base (DB) and train the model in
          a way that it provides accurate answers without hallucinating or generating
          false information.</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance for your time and assistance. I look forward to
          engaging in fruitful discussions with all of you.</p>
