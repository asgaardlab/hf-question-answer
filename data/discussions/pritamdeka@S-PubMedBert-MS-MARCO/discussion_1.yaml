          \ Thanks for the interest in the model. To answer your question, training\
          \ a model over other specific scientific text would result in better embeddings.\
          \ However, till date there is no scientific text dataset similar to MS-MARCO\
          \ which is predominantly used for training models for information retrieval.\
          \ That is why I have trained this model with MS-MARCO. However, if there\
          \ is a similar dataset for scientific or medical information retrieval,\
          \ then this particular model can be trained over that data to get better\
          \ embeddings. Research has shown that in such situations where there is\
          \ less amount of data available, intermediate training works better. So,\
          \ in this situation, since the model has already learnt using the MS-MARCO\
          \ dataset, it can be further trained to enhance performance. I have myself\
          \ experimented with the SCIFACT dataset and I have published those results\
          \ as well. In subsequent research of mine, I have found that it also works\
          \ in NLI datasets as well. I am providing link to one such research work\
          \ on intermediate training . Also, feel free to reach out if you have doubts,\
          \ always happy to help. </p>\n<p><a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01088\"\
