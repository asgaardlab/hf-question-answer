    \ you could replace \"rapid prototyping\" with \"rapid prototyping and testing\"\
    \ to make it more clear.\r\n8. In the eighth sentence, you could replace \"creation\
    \ of south-south networks\" with \"establishment of south-south connections\"\
    \ to make it more concise.\r\n9. In the ninth sentence, you could replace \"social\
    \ glue\" with \"social cohesion\" to make it more clear.\r\nHere is the revised\
    \ essay:\r\nOur paper focuses on understanding the micro level dynamics of a software\
    \ development team working together largely within a south-south framework to\
    \ develop a rather complex patient specific ART application. We contend that the\
    \ learning-by-doing approach adopted for this development process helps to address\
    \ some of the challenges of \"design-reality\" gaps that traditional north-south\
    \ development models tend to magnify. Three key aspects of the learning-by-doing\
    \ approach are emphasized: rapid prototyping and testing in close collaboration\
    \ with users, establishment of south-south connections, and creation of social\
    \ cohesion."
