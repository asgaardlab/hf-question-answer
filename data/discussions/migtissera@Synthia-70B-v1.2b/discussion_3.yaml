        html: '<p>Yeah, it''s greatest local model I''ve seen so far. Seems far more
          smart than anything else local I''ve tried before. Seems for me pretty close
          to Claude and GPT4, infinitely better than 3.5 turbo, for example. Thanks
          to great people hosting it on KoboldHorde!</p>

          <p>Btw, so far for me model seems to do best with temp 0.5, Top P=1, Top
          K=Top A=0, rep penalty =1 and mirostat stats off.</p>

          <p>It''s definitely not on par with GPT-4 for all use cases, but I agree
          this model is very good. It probably matches Claude, but Claude is very
          good in safety alignment, which I haven''t focused on with Synthia models.</p>

          <p>This is the first time I''m hearing about Kobold Horde! Very interesting
          -- I''m glad they''re hosting Synthia.</p>

          <p>I have a new model coming out in the next few days, Synthia-13B-v1.2.
          I''m hoping this would provide the coverage needed for lower sized models,
          as the 34B model is not that great. The 34B is based on CodeLLaMA, and because
          of that it''s not great for general purpose use.</p>
