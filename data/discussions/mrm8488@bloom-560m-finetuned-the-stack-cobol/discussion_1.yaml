          <p>First of all, very interesting project which raised some questions for
          me:<br>I was wondering how the fine-tuned data looked liked? Was it code-snippets
          with text explaining the code (aka docstrings)?<br>Was the model trained
          to generate code or explain cobol code?</p>

          <p>Thanks and best regards,<br>Christian </p>
