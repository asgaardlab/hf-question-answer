        html: '<p>Hey mate, after I have now made some tests and tests, I can now
          say with certainty that this is one of the absolute top models in the 7B
          segment - If not the best ever! What fascinates me about this model is that
          it really seems to be an all-rounder (previously only known from Vicuna).
          I don''t know how you managed this magic, but the model is actually also
          smarter than other 7B models in my tests. Partially Code-CherryPop scores
          double in my tests compared to other 7B models. In my tests it is mainly
          about logic and reasoning. However, even in the subjective assessment of
          its creative writing ability, this model consistently remains my favorite
          because it simultaneously pays very good attention to my instruction, gets
          into roles very well, AND continues to be informative and factual.</p>

          <p>The model may make a superficial impression on the user at first because
          it likes to use <em>starred descriptions</em> and often repeats itself on
          this aspect. Also, the generous use of emojis might give a new user the
          impression that the model is crude or something similar. But this appearance
          is very deceptive.</p>

          <p>So to sum it up: I am very grateful for your work and admire your model.
          I know it''s not always better to take the same data set for a larger model,
          but I''d still be interested to see how a 13B model would behave with your
          training approach. Is there any prospect of you creating another larger
          CherryPop model? Or would you please please tell me how to do it myself
          and what I would need to do it?</p>

          <p>Oh yes, as in the headline, I find that this model also gets too little
          attention at the moment and wonder why it is not much better known? Is there
          anything I can do to help you "market" the model better (besides writing
          a Reddit post on LocallLama about it today)? If so, let me know.</p>
