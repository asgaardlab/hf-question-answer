        html: '<p>I instructed it to not use javascript in html code. And then i modified
          the prompt up to the point where i told it several different ways to not
          use js, javascript or <code>&lt; </code>script<code> &gt;</code> tags. (
          Guess what, huggingface does not sanitize it''s inputs lol, i had to edit
          this comment because it totally ate the script tag )</p>

          <p>It does not care, crams js everywhere, and has the audacity to tell me
          the code does not use javascript but won''t work without it :)</p>

          <p>I''m not sure what to think about it because it seems to produce working
          code, but it''s terrible at following instructions.</p>

          <p>I did more testing and this hopeless.</p>

          <p>I literally gave it a full working example of how to do the thing I want
          without javascript, and it said it understands, and then proceeded to completely
          disregard the example or the prompt and smeared javascript all over the
          code.</p>

          <p>Example piece of it''s output:</p>

          <pre><code class="language-});">    &lt;/script&gt;

          &lt;/body&gt;

          &lt;/html&gt;

          <p>My prompt, more or less, consisted of copying the first example from
