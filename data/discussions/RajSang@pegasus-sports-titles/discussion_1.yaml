        html: '<p>Hello Andy,</p>

          <p>So basically the max_length here in the config file refers  to the length
          of the generated title (which during training was set to 64). So if you
          have manually changed this to 512 , you are getting this warning since your
          input text is of length 309 which is shorter than the max_length. However
          because during training most titles were constrained to lengths below 64,
          setting this max_length feature will not affect the title length drastically
          and titles should still be below 64 tokens in length. Note that this is
          different from the max_position_embeddings=512 which means that your input
          to the title generator must be at most 512 words (since it can only encode
          positional information for up to 512 tokens). </p>

          <p>As for the code, I will try searching for it (must be on my old laptop
          somewhere). Hope you like the model!</p>

          <p>Best,<br>Raj</p>
