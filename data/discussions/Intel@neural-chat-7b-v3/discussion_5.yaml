        html: '<p>even at .60 an hour it was heavy, especially with the renewed popularity
          of this model . </p>

          <p>It would be great if Intel made a demo and requested a community grant
          , but since i dont have one for this deployment, I simply cant go on. </p>

          <p>Hope y''all understand and the many folks that did try it , did enjoy
          it . </p>
