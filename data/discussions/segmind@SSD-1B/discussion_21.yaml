        html: '<p>Hey, great model and thanks for sharing the hyperparams! I''m scaling
          the learning rate to use with lower batch size and it help my SDXL training.
          I''m considering to fine-tune with this model soon, but I have some question.</p>

          <p>When you mention "Steps: 251000", are those pure steps without considering
          the batch size and grad accumulation? Or have they already been divided
          by the batch size/grad steps, like around 1960 steps? Also, it''d probably
          be helpful if you could also provide the number of epochs. </p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
