        html: '<p>Question: What do you recommend for first time startup founders?</p>

          <p>Answer: So I''ll give a couple of pieces of advice. First, don''t be
          afraid to ask questions and get help from people who have done this before.
          It is really easy as an early stage founder to feel like you should know
          everything about your business or that asking other people will make it
          seem like you aren''t smart enough to run the company yourself. But in reality,
          there are so many things that you just won''t learn by reading books or
          watching videos on YouTube. And if you try to figure them out all by yourself,
          you''re gonna waste tons of time and energy doing stuff wrong when someone
          else could tell you how to do it right immediately. Second, find some way
          to measure what matters most to your business. This can be anything from
          revenue to active users to retention rate. Whatever metric you choose, pick
          1 thing that you think best represents whether your product is working well
          at its core. Then track it every day and use it to guide your decision making.
          If something isn''t growing fast enough, then maybe you need to change course.
          Or if something is growing too quickly, maybe you need to scale up faster
          than expected. The point here is not to obsess over any single number but
          rather to keep tabs on which parts of your business are performing well
          and which ones might need more attention. Third, build relationships with
          investors. You may never raise money from these specific individuals, but
          they''ve seen hundreds of companies go through YC and they understand exactly
          why startups fail. They also tend to be pretty good at spotting promising
          ideas even though those ideas haven''t been executed yet. Investor meetings
          are great opportunities to practice pitching your idea and getting feedback
          on it. Even better, they often lead to introductions to potential customers,
          employees, partners, etcetera. Finally, remember that building a successful
          company takes years. Don''t expect to launch your MVP tomorrow and become
          the next billion dollar unicorn within months. That almost never happens.
          Instead, focus on learning as much as possible during the earliest stages
          of your company. Build something that works and iterate until it doesn''t
          suck anymore. Once you reach that point, repeat the process again and again
          until you''ve built something truly valuable. Alright. Thank you very much
          everyone.</p>

        html: '<p>Question: How can an artist start a business selling art successfully?</p>

          <p>Answer: So let''s talk about how to sell your work. This is something
          that I think artists have the most trouble with, and it''s really important
          because if you don''t know how to do this well, then you won''t be able
          to make money from what you love doing. And so here are some tips for getting
          started on this journey of learning how to sell your own work. First off,
          you need to understand who your customer is. You should not just assume
          that everyone will want to buy your stuff or even like your stuff. It turns
          out there''s actually a lot more people in the world than just you. There
          might be other people who would rather spend their time and money on things
          besides yours. So first step is figuring out exactly who those customers
          are. Secondly, you wanna figure out where they hang out online. If you''re
          trying to reach them through social media, which is probably the best way
          these days, you gotta find out where they go online. What platforms do they
          use? Do they read blog posts? Are they active on Instagram? Or maybe they
          only listen to podcasts. Maybe they never get on Facebook at all. Whatever
          platform they''re using, you need to learn how to speak their language.
          Third thing is you need to create content specifically designed to appeal
          to those potential customers. Now, when we say content, we mean anything
          that you put up online. That could include photos of your paintings, videos
          of yourself painting, articles explaining why someone else should care about
          buying your artwork, whatever it may be. The point is you need to give people
          a reason to pay attention to you. Fourth tip is you need to build relationships
          with those potential customers. Don''t try to trick anyone into liking you
          by pretending to be someone you aren''t. Instead, show them who you truly
          are as an artist and as a person. People respond much better to authenticity
          than they do to fakeness. Fifth tip is you need to ask for sales directly.
          Most artists hate asking for sales. They feel uncomfortable talking about
          themselves and their work. But guess what? No one wants to hear about your
          feelings. Your fans want to see your artwork. They want to hear about new
          projects you''ve been working on. They want to hear about any events coming
          up soon. In short, they want to hear about everything related to your art
          career except for how you personally feel about it. Sixth tip is you need
          to keep track of every single sale you ever make. Even if it seems small,
          write down each transaction somewhere. Keep track of how many pieces sold,
          how much revenue was generated, and how long did it take to complete each
          piece. These numbers will help you determine whether you''re making progress
          over time. Finally, number 7, you need to experiment constantly. Try different
          ways of reaching your audience. Try different types of products. Try different
          prices. Try different promotions. Just remember that nothing works forever.
          Everything eventually gets stale. So always be looking for new ideas and
          new experiments to run. Alright. Let me summarize today''s lecture. We talked
          about how to identify your unique value proposition. How to turn that into
          a compelling story, and finally, how to communicate that story effectively
          to others. Next week, we''ll dive deeper into the topic of communicating
          your story. Specifically, we''ll look at how to tell stories visually. Thanks
          again for watching. See you next week.</p>

    listen to podcasts. Maybe they never get on Facebook at all. Whatever platform
    they''re using, you need to learn how to speak their language. Third thing is
    you need to create content specifically designed to appeal to those potential
    customers. Now, when we say content, we mean anything that you put up online.
    That could include photos of your paintings, videos of yourself painting, articles
    explaining why someone else should care about buying your artwork, whatever it
    may be. The point is you need to give people a reason to pay attention to you.
    Fourth tip is you need to build relationships with those potential customers.
    Don''t try to trick anyone into liking you by pretending to be someone you aren''t.
    Instead, show them who you truly are as an artist and as a person. People respond
    much better to authenticity than they do to fakeness. Fifth tip is you need to
    ask for sales directly. Most artists hate asking for sales. They feel uncomfortable
    talking about themselves and their work. But guess what? No one wants to hear
    about your feelings. Your fans want to see your artwork. They want to hear about
    new projects you''ve been working on. They want to hear about any events coming
    up soon. In short, they want to hear about everything related to your art career
    except for how you personally feel about it. Sixth tip is you need to keep track
    of every single sale you ever make. Even if it seems small, write down each transaction
    somewhere. Keep track of how many pieces sold, how much revenue was generated,
    and how long did it take to complete each piece. These numbers will help you determine
    whether you''re making progress over time. Finally, number 7, you need to experiment
    constantly. Try different ways of reaching your audience. Try different types
    of products. Try different prices. Try different promotions. Just remember that
    nothing works forever. Everything eventually gets stale. So always be looking
    for new ideas and new experiments to run. Alright. Let me summarize today''s lecture.
    We talked about how to identify your unique value proposition. How to turn that
    into a compelling story, and finally, how to communicate that story effectively
    to others. Next week, we''ll dive deeper into the topic of communicating your
    story. Specifically, we''ll look at how to tell stories visually. Thanks again
    for watching. See you next week.'
