        html: '<p>Hi Chien,<br>Thanks for your excellent work on proposing the fine-tuning
          whisper model. I am interested in the experiment result you show on the
          model card.</p>

          <p>So, I already grabbed your fine-tuned version and re-run the evaluation,
          but the result did look as expected. It''s even not good as compared to
          the original model when inference on the test set of the <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/mozilla-foundation/common_voice_11_0/viewer/ja/test">common-voice-11</a>
          dataset.</p>

          <p>Here is the top 100 sample (WER, CER avg at the end of file) in the test
          set among 3 different models: <a href="https://huggingface.co/openai/whisper-large-v2">original
          version</a>, your version, and <a rel="nofollow" href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text">whisper

          <p>I think that there may be a mismatch when I am using your model, could

          <p>I appreciate your interest in my work.</p>

          <p>In order to fine-tune the whisper model for the Japanese language, I
          implemented a different preprocess approach compared to the Open AI team.<br>This
          was due to the unique nature of the Japanese language. </p>

          <p>If you want to evaluate the WER and CER, splitting the sentence into
          meaningful words is essential, just like in English.<br>Below is the code
          snippet I utilized to assess the fine-tuned model. </p>
