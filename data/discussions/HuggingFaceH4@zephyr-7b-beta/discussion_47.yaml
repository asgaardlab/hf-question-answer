        html: '<p>Hey, I tried zephyr today, the response was weird as It was not
          following <code>system</code> prompt and giving answer without following
          the rules I have described in the <code>system</code> prompt.<br>The instruction
          was to generate JSON from each prompt from user and storing data that user
          passed in prompt, but it could not generate JSON as described. Sometimes
          it generates JSON then at that time It uses dummy values, for that I also
          added instructions but still it was not followed.</p>

          <p>Any How someone can tell me prompt style for zephyr and how can I achieve
          my task here.</p>
