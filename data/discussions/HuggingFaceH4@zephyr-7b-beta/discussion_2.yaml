        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>It seems that Zephyr-beta is running through some issues while dealing
          with low temperatures. The output easily gets corrupted after a relatively
          small number of tokens (~500). I don''t know if other people are experiencing
          it as I am.</p>

          <p>top_p = 0.95<br>temperature &lt; 0.1</p>

          <p>Any idea?<br>If more people is having same issue, I can paste more details
          over here.</p>

          <p>Best,</p>

          <p>Fernando</p>
