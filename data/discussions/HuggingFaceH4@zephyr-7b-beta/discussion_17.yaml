        html: '<p>Zephyr Alpha/Beta seems excellent, with a major exception. It doesn''t
          handle long context as well as Amazon''s MistraLite 32K model: </p>

          <p><a href="https://huggingface.co/amazon/MistralLite">https://huggingface.co/amazon/MistralLite</a></p>

          <p>Are there any plan''s to adopt some of Amazon''s tricks, such as the
          very large <code>rope_theta</code>, the 16K sliding window, and the 16K
          training? Whatever they did seems to work extremely well, better than other
          long context Llama finetunes/Loras I''ve tried.</p>
