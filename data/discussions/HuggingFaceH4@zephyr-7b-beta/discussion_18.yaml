          <p>The original paper have the DPO version that can deal with multiple ranked
          responses. </p>

          <p>Since you guys are ranking responses from 4 models using the UltraFeedback
          framework, using the Plackett-Luce version might very likely provide more
          information to the instruction tuning process with only twice the computation
          cost. </p>

          <p>Why did you guys decide not to do it but instead saved "the highest scoring
          response as yw and a random lower scoring prompt as yl" from the four responses?</p>
