  content: "> Hi! \n> For these kind of problems, it would be good to open an issue\
    \ on the leaderboard's discussions next time, so we can give you a hand :)\n>\
    \ We have an [FAQ](https://huggingface.co/spaces/HuggingFaceH4/open_llm_leaderboard/discussions/179)\
    \ : if a model stops appearing in the queues, it usually means that evaluating\
    \ it failed. \n> \n> I checked for your specific model, and that's indeed what\
    \ happened (connection problem when downloading the weights, it happens sometimes).\
    \ \n> It's been relaunched, we'll see if it fits in memory - if it does, you'll\
    \ get results in a couple of days.\n\nIs it solved? I still cannot find goliath-120b\
    \ on the leaderboard. Really looking forward to see its results."
