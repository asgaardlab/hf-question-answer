          <p>First of all, thanks a lot for making this model publicly available!
          I am very interested in how you performed the anonymization and removal
          of patient context in the training data. I''ve read that you used an entitiy
          recognition model for this. Could you give me any insight into which model
          was used and if you had to fine tune the ENR model to function with medical
          texts?</p>

          <p>Thanks for your answer!</p>

          <p>we are fortunate that patient information is not typically saved in the
          report texts but in a separate file. So it was easy to remove. However,
          we still removed names of doctors from the data. </p>

          <ol>

          <li>We used FLAIR NLP to identify names and then manually checked the least
          frequent entries (most frequent entries were no names but other nouns).
          </li>

          <li>We then also used RegEx to remove names. Doctors are usually referred
          to as "Dr. XYZ" or "Prof. XYZ", "OA XYZ". So a simple RegEx could identify
          most cases.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Together these methods allowed us to achieve a satisfactory anonymization
          of the texts. </p>
