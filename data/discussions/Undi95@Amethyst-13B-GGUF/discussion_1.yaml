          <p>I feel like huggin v1.2 for logic and xwin for prose should be enough
          and maybe too many models in the merge would dilute xwin''s narrative rich
          sentence structure (unless it was similar models like synthia). </p>

          <p>If it were me I''d do huggin v1.2 + stheno for logic in the gradient
          mix (maybe ties merge - Ties merges seem better for logic preservation I
          think, ideally it could hold on to some of huggin''s emergent CoT whilst
          gaining stheno''s coherency and logic), and xwin + synthia + chronos for
          prose (this could be a slerp - slerps seem better for creativity. xwin and
          synthia have similar deep narrative sentence structure, xwin having a slight
          edge but lack chronos'' great adjective use, actual word prose). I dream
          of GPU''s.....and I probably don''t know what I''m talking about. </p>

          <p>Anyway, by all means, ignore me :P Thanks for the amazing merge work
          you do. You are a machine!</p>
