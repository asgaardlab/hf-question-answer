        html: '<p>When attempting to execute ''5_generate_clmbr_features.py'', I receive
          an error stating that the seed cannot be found in the config. I checked
          and indeed, there is no seed written in the config. Could there be something
          I am doing wrong? Or is it correct that the config does not include information
          about the seed? Please help me confirm this.</p>

          <p>Additionally, I noticed that the bash_scripts on <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/som-shahlab/ehrshot-benchmark">https://github.com/som-shahlab/ehrshot-benchmark</a>
          seem different from what is described.</p>

          <p>Also, regarding the installation command ''pip install git+<a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/som-shahlab/femr.git@ehrshot_branch''">https://github.com/som-shahlab/femr.git@ehrshot_branch''</a>,
          it appears that the ehrshot_branch of femr does not exist. Therefore, I
          installed the main branch of femr instead. Could this be the reason why
          the config I mentioned earlier is different?</p>

          <p>Thank you for your assistance.</p>
