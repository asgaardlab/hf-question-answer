          <p>Fixed Instruct Preset:<br>There was some wishful thinking junk in the
          existing preset that I removed, and some style guide stuff that shouldn''t
          have been there (and would break lots of cards), and the model does MUCH
          better using mistral instruct than it does under Alpaca.  I fixed that.<br><a

          <p>It''s probably not a bad idea to fix your context template to have [INST]
          [/INST] around it, too.  I''m not going to bother to make a preset for that,
          anyone can do that themselves.</p>

          <p>Thanks, Undi!</p>

          <p>Like I said in discord, this is the closest Noromaid to "usable" we''ve
          seen so far.  Better than the non-instruct.</p>
