        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I just wanted to say, this model does feel smarter than goliath-120b,
          and I haven''t run into alignment issues (even if it might be slightly more
          aligned with an empty or light context). I don''t feel it''s any less fun,
          though. </p>

          <p>Overall, it''s a great effort, and I hope you continue experimenting
          with models and merges in the future. Thanks for sharing! </p>
