        html: '<p>Thank you; it works perfectly. Well, since you provided more models
          for testing, I also tested WildMBXMarconi and TurdusTrixBeagle while comparing
          them. I gave them 3 puzzles, asked to finalize the idea with the character,
          but also asked to create a super short sci-fi thriller and chat with them
          just with a few messages.<br>WestOrcaNeuralMarco: Replies length: Long.
          WestOrca feels the most engaging of all 3 models. It successfully resolved
          2+ out of 3 puzzles (Replied correctly after one regeneration.) With this
          model, you don''t need to ask, "What do you propose?" Just give it the topic,
          and it will give proposals and suggestions even if you aren''t intending
          to ask for them. It''s a very proactive model with long and multifaceted
          replies with good logical capabilities. The only downside I would say is
          that its proactivity may turn into a monologue, especially during creative
          writing. Instead of co-creating, it tends to create on its own. Without
          even understanding what I want to see, moreover, it may generate side characters
          and plot points with its start and end, which I didn''t ask for, lmao. The
          reason for that is it begins to answer questions that it guesses could be
          asked. Similar behavior I saw with NeuralBeagle14, and still, I should say
          that here it is less pronounced, which is good.<br>Storytelling - Naturally,
          I don''t expect anything extraordinary, and I would say the detective was
          not very logical and a bit blurred in the plot; TurdusTrix did better. We
          also discussed my day with it, and in casual chat, the model definitely
          feels better than the other two, more engaging and adaptive than TurdusTrix
          or WildMBX. Overall, despite some coherence issues, it compensates with
          creativity and engagement. I believe tactfulness can be increased with sys
          prompt.<br>Now a bit about two other models.<br>TurdusTrixBeagle: Replies
          length: Mid/Balanced. This model looked more tactful in terms of turn-based
          dialogue, much less proactive, engaging, or curious. It won''t answer what
          you don''t intend to ask, as WestOrca can do. Once it even said, ''I can
          suggest if you are interested'' and waited until you gave permission. It
          resolved 2/3 puzzles. It also feels a bit more coherent than WestOrca in
          some cases but loses in the naturalness of speech that WestOrca has and
          adaptivity to understand mistakes, for example in puzzle. The detective
          story turned out to be more specific in details, better structured, and
          logical than that of WestOrca.<br>WildMBXMarconi: Replies length: Short.
          Isn''t intended for creative writing; it was unstructured somewhat. And
          I wouldn''t say it is more logical than WestOrca. It resolved 2/3 puzzles,
          still it can understnad mistake. It also replies with shorter and more concentrated
          replies, much like OpenChat. Just compared to WestOrca, this model summarizes
          its answers into shorter ones. Still, even though replies are shorter, it
          is more engaging than TurdusTrix.</p>

          <p>P.S. The issue was with this puzzle: "There are 10 killers in a room.
          The 11th killer enters the room and closes the door behind him. He kills
          one of the 10 killers. How many killers remain alive in the room in total?"
          This was the final reply of WildMBX: "So after all these events unfold,
          there are still...10 - 1 + 1 = 9 Killers left in that chilling room." Like
          reasoning was correct but incorrect final number. At the same time WestOrca
          replied correctly with right reasoning so I think or this puzzle is already
          hidden somewhere in the WestOrca datasets, or its role-playing abilities
          allow it to better imagine how many people are in the room.</p>

          <p>It was just a first impression, but I believe it is mostly correct. Thank
          you for your models! WestOrca feels a bit more adaptive and calm than NeuralBeagle14
          and more coherent than WestLake v2. Good merge, keep it up.)</p>
