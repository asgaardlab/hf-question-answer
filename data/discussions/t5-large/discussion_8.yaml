        html: '<p>I am using the t5-large to determine whether a premise and hypothesis
          are related. That is whether the answer is an entailment, contradiction,
          or neutral. </p>

          <p>I am trying to reproduce the first step of this paper (<a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://research.google/pubs/pub51307/">https://research.google/pubs/pub51307/</a>)
          where they used the t5-11b and predicted whether a premise and hypothesis
          are related. They also calculated a score. For example, if a pair gave entailment,
          they also calculated P(entailment). They used the checkpoints from Google''s
          repository directly.</p>

          <p>I tried to find out whether this can be done using the model from HugginfFace.
          This is the code I am currently using. This just gives textual representation,
          whether something is entailment or contradiction, or neutral. I also was
          able to get some scores but not sure how to use them to calculate probability.
          </p>

          <p>Any help to calculate the probability would be appreciated!</p>
