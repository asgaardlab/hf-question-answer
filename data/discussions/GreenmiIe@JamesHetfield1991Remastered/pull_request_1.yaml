      subject: In the darkness, chaos reigns, a storm inside my brain, Twisted thoughts,
        relentless pain, driving me insane. The world's a furnace, burning bright,
        fueling all my fears, Demons whisper, shadows dance, as madness nears. Raise
        the anxiety, let it consume, In this maelstrom of despair, I'll find my doom.
        Scream it to the heavens, let the tempest rise, In this symphony of madness,
        we'll claim the prize. In this nightmare's twisted grip, I'll embrace the
        storm, Rising from the depths of hell, where nightmares are born. Shattered
        dreams and broken souls, we're the ones who'll thrive, In this pandemonium
        we've built, we'll come alive. Raise the anxiety, let it consume, In this
        maelstrom of despair, I'll find my doom. Scream it to the heavens, let the
        tempest rise, In this symphony of madness, we'll claim the prize. Guitar solo
        of pure chaos and mayhem.  In this pandemonium, we'll unleash the beast, Anxiety,
        our guiding star, as we unleash the feast. Screaming through the endless void,
        our voices will ignite, The flames of torment, burning bright, in this eternal
        fight.  Raise the anxiety, let it consume, In this maelstrom of despair, I'll
        find my doom. Scream it to the heavens, let the tempest rise, In this symphony
        of madness, we'll claim the prize.  As the chaos fades away, and the darkness
        wanes, We'll raise the anxiety, forever in our veins. In this anthem of the
        damned, we'll forever thrive, In the depths of madness, where we will never
        die.

title: In the darkness, chaos reigns, a storm inside my brain, Twisted thoughts, relentless
  pain, driving me insane. The world's a furnace, burning bright, fueling all my fears,
  Demons whisper, shadows dance, as madness nears. Raise the anxiety, let it consume,
  In this maelstrom of despair, I'll find my doom. Scream it to the heavens, let the
  tempest rise, In this symphony of madness, we'll claim the prize. In this nightmare's
  twisted grip, I'll embrace the storm, Rising from the depths of hell, where nightmares
  are born. Shattered dreams and broken souls, we're the ones who'll thrive, In this
  pandemonium we've built, we'll come alive. Raise the anxiety, let it consume, In
  this maelstrom of despair, I'll find my doom. Scream it to the heavens, let the
  tempest rise, In this symphony of madness, we'll claim the prize. Guitar solo of
  pure chaos and mayhem.  In this pandemonium, we'll unleash the beast, Anxiety, our
  guiding star, as we unleash the feast. Screaming through the endless void, our voices
  will ignite, The flames of torment, burning bright, in this eternal fight.  Raise
  the anxiety, let it consume, In this maelstrom of despair, I'll find my doom. Scream
  it to the heavens, let the tempest rise, In this symphony of madness, we'll claim
  the prize.  As the chaos fades away, and the darkness wanes, We'll raise the anxiety,
  forever in our veins. In this anthem of the damned, we'll forever thrive, In the
  depths of madness, where we will never die.
