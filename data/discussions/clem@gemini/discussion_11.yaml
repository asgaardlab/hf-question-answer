        html: '<p>The open source implementation of Gemini, the model that will "eclipse
          ChatGPT", it seems to work by directly taking in all modalities without
          an encoder for some kind which means that the encoding is built into the
          modal.</p>

          <p>The input sequences for Gemini consist of texts, audio, images, and videos.
          These inputs are transformed into tokens, which are then processed by a
          transformer. Subsequently, conditional decoding takes place to generate
          image outputs.</p>

          <p>Interestingly, the architecture of Gemini bears resemblance to Fuyu''s
          architecture but is expanded to encompass multiple modalities. Instead of
          utilizing a visual transformer (vit) encoder, Gemini simply feeds image
          embeddings directly into the transformer.</p>

          <p>For Gemini, the token inputs will likely be indicated by special modality
          tokens such as [IMG], , [AUDIO], or . Codi, a component of Gemini, also
          employs conditional generation and makes use of the tokenized outputs.</p>

          <p>To implement this model effectively, I intend to initially focus on the
          image embeddings to ensure their smooth integration. Subsequently, I will
          proceed with incorporating audio embeddings and then video embeddings.</p>

          <p>Clem, would you be open minded to collaborate? We''re almost done implementing
