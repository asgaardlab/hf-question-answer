        html: '<p>Hi, I''m new to video tasks. I notice that the model processes only
          8 frames per video (config.json). I see it pretty ineffective because it
          may lose a lot of information of minutes long video. Do we need to pre-train
          the model from scratch to increase the number of frames? Could you please
          give me some advises? I would appreciate it. Thank you in advanced. </p>

        html: '<p>Thank you for your attention. We''re actually focusing on short
          videos at the moment. It has been the case that long videos are not that
          well handled. The reason for this is that if the inputs are dense, then
          the model will be overwhelmed. If the output is not dense then the feature
          information will be lost. Maybe I''m wondering if I should do an advance
          query based on the text to extract certain tokens from a frame, which might
          reduce the complexity of the video model and allow more frames to be input.</p>
