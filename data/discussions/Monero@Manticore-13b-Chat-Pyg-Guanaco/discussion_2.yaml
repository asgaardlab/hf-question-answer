        html: '<p>I use the ggml version (q4_0) quantized by Mindrage, and I''m amazed!<br>It''s
          surprisingly "pertinent" for a 13b in terms of writing quality, and I almost
          feel like I''m testing a 33b model, with the speed of a smaller one. Bravo!<br>To
          be fully honest, I wish that the 4096 ctx length training (I hope I use
          the right word) used by bluemoonrp could be used in such a model (it usually
          works well with a 2816-3072 ctx in KoboldCPP, for example), in order to
          make it even more awesome!</p>
