          [`meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf)

          **Why add this?** Enhancing your model''s metadata in this way:

          - **Boosts Discoverability** - It becomes straightforward to trace the relationships
          between various models on the Hugging Face Hub.

          - **Highlights Impact** - It showcases the contributions and influences
          different models have within the community.
