        html: '<p>Hi. I have an issue trying to install it.</p>

          <p>I use Automatic1111. I entered "<a href="https://huggingface.co/Froddan/model_compare_script&quot;">https://huggingface.co/Froddan/model_compare_script"</a>
          in "Extensions &gt; install from url" and let it install, I restarted, but
          the script doesn''t appear in the list.</p>

          <p>Instead I tried installing it manually. I opened a GIT window in /extensions/
          and entered : "git clone <a href="https://huggingface.co/Froddan/model_compare_script&quot;">https://huggingface.co/Froddan/model_compare_script"</a>,
          and restarted, but same, no new script in the list.</p>

          <p>I also tried copying manually "generate_model_grid.py" in the /scripts/
          folder, and restarted, but still nothing happens.</p>

          <p>Can you help please ?</p>
