        html: '<p>Some questions about the final PrefixLM finetuning procedure mentioned
          in the model card (0.92 billion tokens on a mixture of Pile/COT/NI/P3):</p>

          <ul>

          <li>How was the mixture sampled and packed for sequence length 2048?<ul>

          <li>Specifically, does a single 2048-length sequence consist of packed examples
          from a single dataset, unpacked examples from a single dataset, or packed
          examples individually sampled from the overall mixture?</li>

          </ul>

          </li>

          <li>How were NI/P3 examples deduplicated? The original dataset cards mention
          there are potential duplicate inputs<ul>

          <li>NI reference: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/natural-instructions">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/natural-instructions</a></li>

          <li>P3 reference: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/P3">https://huggingface.co/datasets/Muennighoff/P3</a></li>

          </ul>

          </li>

          <li>Were the instruction datasets (CoT, NI, P3) trained with zero-shot or
          few-shot prompts?<ul>

          <li>a few shot prompt would include an example in the prefix portion of
          the input, which seems particularly salient for CoT.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Thanks so much!</p>
