        html: '<p>Hi GPT-JT team,</p>

          <p>I''m trying to apply UL2 Adaptation to a 1.5B GPT model, and I''m noticing
          that in the first few steps of UL2 training, model performance on few-shot
          evaluation  decreases significantly before slowly increasing again (for
          example, see the attached figure).  Do you guys have observations on how
          the model performance changes over the course of UL2 training? Thanks!</p>

          <p>Evaluation details:<br>We use the Eleuther-AI LM evaluation harness (<a
