          <h2 id="gpt-jt-could-improve">GPT-JT (could improve):</h2>

          <p>Answer the following questions as an expert, explaining your reasoning
          in steps.</p>

          <p>Question: How many months does it take for two women to give birth to
          five babies with no twins?<br>Answer: A human pregnancy has an average gestation
          period of nine months. Two women could undergo pregnancy at the same time.
          They would first produce two babies for nine months, then two more for another
          nine months, then one of them could have another baby for nine months. Overall,
          that would take twenty-seven months.</p>

          <p>Question: Who was the father of the first French king?<br>Answer: The
          first French king was Clovis I. His father was Childeric I.</p>

          <p>Question: How much time would a dolphin take to circumnavigate the Earth?<br>Answer:
          <strong>[A dolphin can swim at a speed of about 20 miles per hour. It takes
          the dolphin about one day to swim around the Earth.]</strong></p>

          <h2 id="gpt-3">GPT-3:</h2>

          <p>Question: How much time would a dolphin take to circumnavigate the Earth?<br>Answer:
          <strong>[A typical bottlenose dolphin swims at a speed of about 8 km/h.
          If a dolphin were to circumnavigate the Earth, it would have to swim approximately
          40,075 km. At 8 km/h, it would take the dolphin approximately 5,009 hours,
          or 209 days, to circumnavigate the Earth.]</strong></p>
