        html: '<p>This model is fantastic, I''m speechless! </p>

          <p>However, it seems to me that the upscaling process does not do justice
          to the PaperCut creations . I''m creating a video, using deforum, and the
          upscaling I''m using (realesr-animevideov3) seems to ruin the results a
          bit. Do you have any advice how to properly upscale the PaperCut creations?</p>

          <p>UPDATE: here are the finished results: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCZOD2AQCFg">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BCZOD2AQCFg</a></p>
