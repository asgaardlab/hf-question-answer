          The chart demonstrates that life expectancy at birth has increased steadily

          years was reached in 2017. The graph shows a steady upward trend, indicating
          a continued improvement in life expectancy. The graph also shows that life
          expectancy at birth has expanded significantly between 2008 and 2017, from
          80.2 years to 80.5 years.</p>
