          <p>If anyone would like to test their machine with fuyu, here is a small
          script that makes fake text + images but is a complete training loop.   It
          is all self-contained and only needs transformers/torch/simple_parsing installed.<br>The
          idea is that since you may not know if the model will fit on your resources,
          better to try this before digging into FSDP/QLoRA/Accelerate.  </p>

          <p>I can add an FSDP/Accelerate/QLoRA example as well since those can be
          hard to get working with this model with limited resources.</p>
