        html: '<p>Thank you for the great work! Regarding the ability to support multi-image,
          does it mean that  fuyu-8b can handle interleaved text and multi-images?
          Could you clarify the input format for the transformer decoder when there
          is interleaved text and multi-images? </p>

          <p>From the blog, it appears that the input for a single image and text
          would be:  [img_patch] [img_patch] \n [img_patch] [img_patch] \n [text].
          </p>

          <p>How would the format change in the scenario where the sequence is "&lt;img1&gt;
          &lt;img2&gt; some text"? Would there be some special image token to separate
          the two images? Or it would be like [img1_patch] [img1_patch] \n [img1_patch]
          [img1_patch] \n [img2_patch] [img2_patch] \n [img2_patch] [img2_patch] \n
          [text]?</p>

          <p>Also,  does <code>FuyuForCausalLM </code>need any modification in order
          to accommodate interleaved text and multi-images?  Thank you!</p>
