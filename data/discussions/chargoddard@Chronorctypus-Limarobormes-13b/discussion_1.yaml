        html: '<p>I am impressed by this model.  I''ve been trying some of these smaller
          models and this one really stood out for its broad knowledge and skill.</p>

          <p>Would you consider making another model like this based on the larger
          TheBloke/Llama-2-70B-fp16 or the chat version of it?  I haven''t tried running
          your script but I can try on one of my machines with 512GB ram, dual Xeon
          CPUs, and dual Tesla M40 24GB GPU cards.  Perhaps I could try making the
          larger 70B conglomerate LLM but, I would need your help with making a list
          of compatible LLMs to merge.</p>
