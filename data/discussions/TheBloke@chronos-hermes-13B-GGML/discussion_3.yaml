        html: '<p>When trying to load a persistent session in llama.cpp with this
          model (q4_0), I get this error. I was using the model with llama.cpp until
          a few moments ago, had to Crtl+C because it seemed stuck repeating the same
          text over and over, tried restarting, and now get this error whenever I
          press .</p>

          <p>Any suggestions on how I can resolve this issue?</p>
