        html: '<p>While roleplaying where it is supposed to stay in character, if
          we say something like ''Are you in US?'' It responds with ''Nope! I am a
          language model developed by researchers from Bud Ecosystem.'' despite having
          mentioned in the prompt to stay in character and not respond as an AI.</p>

          <p>Also is there a way to restrict the model from generating output only
          under x number of characters/words? for ex. only generate output under 10
