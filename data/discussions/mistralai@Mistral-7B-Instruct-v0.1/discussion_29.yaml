          <p>Thank you so so much for this man ! Appreciated. I used this to make
          an app for question answering a pdf. Just wanted to ask that when i use
          this model through this space; on which api does this bounce back from exatcly?
          Is it Openai? or the huggingface''s api for this model? Coz HF''s api wasn''t
          giving the full ouput (only around 10 tokens) when used through langchain.
          And if its openai then how is it free ? Please help. I am a beginner.</p>
