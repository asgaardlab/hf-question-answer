        html: '<p>Hello there !</p>

          <p>I just installed HD on my computer, tried a first run despite having
          an AMD GPU, just to check out if the arguments I put in launch.py were working.
          Turns out that it did work, I managed to generate a proper image. I just
          put in a couple of prompts to try it out, along with the Negative Prompt
          provided to avoid distorted results, and it works fine !</p>

          <p>So, now that I can get to it, I wanted to ask what kind of syntax I should
          use for best/most accurate results ? Should I stick to keywords between
          commas, or can I try to use longer sentences like "2girls holding hands"
          ? (Yeah, I went for the degenerate example)</p>

          <p>Cheers friends ! Have fun !</p>
