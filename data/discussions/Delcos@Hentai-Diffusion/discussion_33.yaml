          this model to become a reality and now it has, and its amazing. </p>

          <p>But why is pubic hair in the negative prompt haha. don''t train it with
          that in there XD </p>

          <p>i would suggest to also incorporate non-japanese ''hentai'' as well,
          like possibly futurama.  It seems to not be so keen on that </p>

          <p>that is all.  I have much support for this! dont let anyone intimidate
          one from doing this work</p>
