        html: '<p>I''m trying to wrap my head around how many times you''ve lied and
          posted this model.<br>Firstly, it''s perfectly fine to train your own model
          trained on DDLC or whatever gelbooru/r34 sites you scrape (even when danbooru2021
          exists). That''s not my problem, nor the virus detection flare-ups from
          pickled files. I dont use reddit and I''m currently at 1 karma in order
          to enter the DDLCr34 club and uncover a lump of shit.</p>

          <p>I don''t get why you''d need to lie about your model results. You''re
          showing off "incremental improvements" and getting some reddit karma on
          the results, and only if users "use the universal negative prompt" you could
          somehow make an infinite monika dreambooth/model  of your own. (<a rel="nofollow"

          fucking years on that platform and people are hating your guts. 10s of Monika
          images posted the same day, credited as "source: me" and "source: self-made
          AI", both of which are verifiable lies, and to which you''re constantly
          called out for it.</p>

          <p>Please, for the sake of any sort of creative effort that''s making you
          want to produce as much Monika art as possible. Tell the truth. Seriously,
          make a model, post AI art (when appropriately tagged), share results; just
          don''t lie about it ffs. Fucking 6 years on reddit, and you''re still trying
