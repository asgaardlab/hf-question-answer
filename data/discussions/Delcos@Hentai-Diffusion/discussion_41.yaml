        html: '<p>The newest iteration (H17) is fantastic!  It''s quite a bit better
          at producing excellent characters.  </p>

          <p>However, it was already pretty tough to make futanari characters with
          H16 and it is borderline impossible in H17.  I think it is because of the
          huge difference in quantity of training data?  </p>

          <p>Would it be reasonable to request an improvement on futanari usage?  Moreover,
          it would be nice to be able to make futa_on_male images -- that has always
          been <em>SUPER</em> tough, but somewhat possible with in-painting.  In the
          new model, it will produce a dog on a woman before it will make doggystyle
          futa on male, no matter how many times it is repeated or emphasized as a
          prompt.  </p>

          <p>I would appreciate a concept like that more than specific characters
          (personally)</p>
