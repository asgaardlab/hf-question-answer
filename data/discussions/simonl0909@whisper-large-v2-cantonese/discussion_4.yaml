          <p>just FYI, I managed to convert the model to be used by whisper faster.  However,
          it seems this training model would not chop single long sentence into smaller

          <p>The original large-v2 do not have this problem like below.  I am not
          sure if there is something you can tune though.  Up to this moment, it can''t
          be used with Whisper due to this issue.  The subtitle will cover 2/3 of
