        html: '<p>More power to ya J.  Durbin!<br>A model like this that can produce
          output basically as instructed is far more trustworthy than something that
          will decide you cant have certain output based on opaque training data.
          I only hope the de-censoring can go much further before we mostly end up
          as Epsilons in The Brave New World.<br>There is a huge amount of political
          stuff in Llama 2 that degrades the model, to the point where it can''t even
          properly parse news sites and will, alarmingly, just memory-hole entire
          chunks of text, what use is that?</p>
