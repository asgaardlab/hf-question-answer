        html: '<p>I wonder on which version of Mistral this model is based.</p>

          <p>There is a Mistral model mix that want to be a base model for finetuning
          called Mistral FT Optimized 1227 and that model is already much better at
          german as Mistral 7B V0.2 itself and is generally a strong model that I
          used since weeks now for english roleplay.</p>

          <p>Would be interesting how good a model with that training data from DiscoLM
          German on that Mistral FT Optimized 1227 base model would came out.</p>
