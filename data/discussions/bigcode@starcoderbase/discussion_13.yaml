        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for creating this model and making it open source. Just wondering
          if it''s possible to fine tune your starcoder base to specialise at a particular
          language which is niche, and as far as I can tell not in the training data.</p>

          <p>In particular, do I just use this (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/blob/main/finetune/finetune.py">https://github.com/bigcode-project/starcoder/blob/main/finetune/finetune.py</a>)
          as a starting point?</p>

          <p>My understanding is since coding languages are all related, they all
          have a common intermediate representation (give or take). So starcoder should
          be fairly cheap to finetune to autocompleting another coding language, with
          a modest budget -- say a $100-$500 range.</p>

          <p>Kind regards,<br>mangoplane</p>
