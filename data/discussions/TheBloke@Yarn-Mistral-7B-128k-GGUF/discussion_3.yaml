          <p>I am using ooba to test these and the exl2 version. They do not seem
          to function and just spit out gibberish when you attempt to use larger context
          windows. Not sure if it is a settings issue (I have looked them over and
          made sure seq length etc all are well above what I am feeding it) or what,
          but since the large context window seemed like the purpose of the models,
          I am not sure what the benefit of these models are if larger context does
          not work.</p>
