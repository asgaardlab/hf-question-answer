          the model kept rambling.</p>

          <p>When checking the logs with all the token ids of the output, it seemed
          to continue even though the 50279 token (aka <code>&lt;|im_end|&gt;</code>
          in this model) kept appearing. This led me to check which token was the
          EOS token in the GGUF, and it was the token 0 (aka <code>&lt;|endoftext|&gt;</code>
          in this model).</p>

          <p>So I found that the EOS token was not correctly set in <code>tokenizer_config.json</code>
          and changed it to <code>&lt;|im_end|&gt;</code> (and then reconverted the
          model to GGUF to test it), and no more rambling!</p>
