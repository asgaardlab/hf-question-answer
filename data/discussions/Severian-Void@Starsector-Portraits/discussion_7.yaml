        html: '<p>That is for sure one of the things near the top of the list for
          things to add if I can find the time to revisit this project at some point.
          It took a while to learn how to do multiple concepts in a single training
          split out by keywords, I did eventually manage it with a project using stellaris
          portraits keyworded out by species. I don''t have the stellaris version
          posted here but you can find it over on the civitai site if you have any
          interest in that one. I don''t currently have any free hobby time to work
          on this but I do at least plan to try and revisit it for some updates at
          some point. Thanks for the feedback though, I am glad you are happy with
          it.</p>
