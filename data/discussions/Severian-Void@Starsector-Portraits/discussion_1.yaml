          <p>Every one of those rows is the LORA version used with a different loaded
          base checkpoint, so you don''t need to use the full model checkpoint I trained
          with the LORA, you can use whatever model checkpoint you want to try. This
          makes the LORA version far more versatile and adaptable and I think it should
          make more sense that the concept of a "starsector portrait" is not really
          a particularly complex idea, so devoting an entire model checkpoint to it
          is pretty overkill.  You can use the LORA with the model checkpoint trained
          here as well, </p>

          <p>The results using the LORA heavily depend on the model checkpoint you
          choose to use it with, base models that have much more training on people
          will produce much better portrait and face features for example. Also, like
          a hypernet LORA can be easily adjusted in how much of an effect they apply
          to the image as well so you can much more easily fine tune things. You can
          use it with the model checkpoint trained here, if you do I would basically
          just use it in place of the hypernet. </p>

          <p>Here is an example I just quickly made using the LORA with the version
          2.1 trained ckpt from here and without the hypernet, sweeping the applied
          strength of the LORA<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6304670c1dd5d3c624890413/I_NXUFmuAFt_KZ9sEJG-L.jpeg"><img

          - 1.0<br>So you can see that when used with the old trained checkpoints
          I made it functions similarly to the hypernet, but the fact the LORA can
          be used with any base checkpoint is really I think what makes it shine.</p>

          <p>The model checkpoint is  pretty much a product of its early time released
          months ago when training capabilities and technologies were much less developed,
          so I see the lora as pretty much a replacement for the old full checkpoint
          version. The LORA being just a single building block you can plug into other
          building blocks to make the image you want compare to the checkpoint which
          is more like the building foundation much more set and less adaptable.</p>

          <p>Yup already added to the training set. I have been testing a bunch of
          different settings and changes to the training process to try and continue
          to improve things which is taking its time. Eventually I should have a new

          <p>One of the things I have been trying to incorporate is some of the things
          I learned making a Stellaris style portrait LORA which let you include a

          in Starsector the goal would be that you could specify a particular faction
