        html: '<p>Hi, Yesterday I tried and successfully managed to make it work on
          my machine with three different models. I see you are using ooobaboga UI
          which is text generation web UI repo on GitHub. I have used the same. I
          am using windows machine. I looked up YouTube tutorial to make it work.
          I did not install the same way as shown in the YouTube. In the GitHub repo,
          there is one click installer. I used that installer and opened the start_windows.bat
          file. It automatically downloaded and installed all the files required into
          the same folder. While installing, it will ask whether you require GPU support
          or not, and what kind of GPU you have. It is so simple and easy to set up
          using this installer.  Once competed, I followed the YouTube tutorial. Here''s
          the link to it: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_86SaCTrM">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ud_86SaCTrM</a></p>

          <p>I hope this helps.</p>
