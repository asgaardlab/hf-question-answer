        html: '<p>Hey Patrick, thanks for your question and feedback. We were tuning
          only on novel format, but the model has understanding of any fiction form
          like a movie script, short story, game branch script. They might need special
          pipelines and be more prone to formatting errors, but they are possible.
          We demonstrate this as a PoC, so that anyone can enhance the model with
          other formats as they need using the same training pipeline.</p>
