        html: '<p>Hi Jared, Thanks for your comment. I''ve noticed what you''ve already
          noticed. Actually, there are some noises in the images. For example, when
          I upload a picture of a man wearing caps, our image caption model starts
          repeating some of the captions. We need enough data to fix this. If you
          can help me by providing data, that would be great.</p>
