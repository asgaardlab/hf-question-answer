        html: '<p>Hi Akhaliq,</p>

          <p>I have tried the OmniMAE model for both images and videos. It looks great!</p>

          <p>Do you have any plan for providing the TF version of this model in HuggingFace
          community? In case if you don''t have a TF version in hand and plan to do
          the conversion, I am happy to help.</p>

          <p>You may contact me at <a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:dwen@linkedin.com">dwen@linkedin.com</a>.
          Thank you very much!</p>
