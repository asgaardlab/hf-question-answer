        html: '<p>Has anyone actually used this for Real Time (near realtime) translation
          yet? So far I have the M4t demo model up and running and I want to get cracking
          at the real time editor.. </p>

          <p>I wonder what''s the best way to go about this.. open up loop with audio
          stream? output a stream of text? Process in chunks? Where would I separate
          audio chunks to pass the model? </p>

          <p>I''m just thinking out loud.. Maybe i''ll start and clip in 2 second
          chunk as I read this is the latency, but I feel it will lose the context
          from more complete chunks.. </p>
