          <p>Model is already released under that license. I don''t think you can
          just change it to a different license without the model being any different,
          so I think <code>Apache-2.0 (commercial use permitted)</code> still applies
          to it.</p>

          <p>At the very least, users who downloaded it when you listed it with that
          license are allowed to use it for commercial use.</p>

          not the door anyone concerned about the creeping scope of copyright wants
          to knock on. Likewise, as a deep skeptic of rigid international laws being
          enforced in individual sovereign nations, I don''t like projects like the
          Berne convention, especially because it precludes things like individual
          treaties or exceptions assuming anyone wants to honor it meaningfully anyway.</p>

          <p>As to Fair Use, it is fairly formalized in America. Moreover there''s
          fairly relevant case law to book processing and digitization in particular
          (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Authors_Guild,_Inc._v._Google,_Inc</a>.)
          that tracks at least in part onto the works and use in question here. Obviously,
          everyone wants to avoid the lawsuit in the first place and I stand by my
          claim that this particular subset of the issue isn''t solved, or doesn''t
          seem to be, but it seems that the transformative nature of creating the
          model essentially divorces the end product from the original work nearly
          entirely. If the book could be readily retrieved AND that was the primary
          purpose and goal of the technology, I could see my way to an agreement there.
          But just like the rulings in US cases relating to home recording of videos
          and tapes, if a technology has a legitimate, legal purpose, it is not in
          the interests of the state or the people to restrict use of that technology
          to please the specific interests of people who might be tangentially aggrieved
          by some part of it (in this case, the somewhat faulty idea that the specific
          relative token weights of  the words in the books are being used as a means
          of stealing some protectable asset).</p>

          <p>That argument is somewhat tangential, but I''d say that there''s not
          a whole lot of meat on the bone for authors as far as America is concerned.
          I could be wrong, it''s not settled by any stretch and I understand Mosaic
          wanting to avoid the legal costs of, in my opinion, misinformed authors
          who believe that the method of operation of these models is, at once, unknowable
          in its divinations and clearly blatant in its workings as a device of perceived
          theft.  Moreover, their lack of understanding of the accessibility, lack
          of necessary transparency, and ease of making LoRAs and finetunes against
          very specific datasets underlies the entire process. There is and will forever
          be no practical way of knowing what data any given model was trained on
          and hyper-specific writing-style models can be trained in hours or days
          on a corpus of works without informing anyone and deleted as soon as the
          text anyone needs generated is done. There will never be a way to watermark
          ascii characters, there will never be any way to obfuscate language against
          machine readability without also obfuscating it from human readability.
          It''s a lost fight, in essence. The genie has flown the bottle and is unlikely
          to return even under pressure from governments, who would be grossly unable
          to govern this because they do not need to exist as large, corporate enterprises
          with budgets and head counts. They are relatively small, easily creatable
          and transferrable files. And all of this is on top of the already, to me,
          unimpressive legal argument that a series of float values constitute the
          legally protectable version of their written word. And again, I say this
          as an author and professional writer.</p>

    that tracks at least in part onto the works and use in question here. Obviously,
    everyone wants to avoid the lawsuit in the first place and I stand by my claim
    that this particular subset of the issue isn''t solved, or doesn''t seem to be,
    but it seems that the transformative nature of creating the model essentially
    divorces the end product from the original work nearly entirely. If the book could
    be readily retrieved AND that was the primary purpose and goal of the technology,
    I could see my way to an agreement there. But just like the rulings in US cases
    relating to home recording of videos and tapes, if a technology has a legitimate,
    legal purpose, it is not in the interests of the state or the people to restrict
    use of that technology to please the specific interests of people who might be
    tangentially aggrieved by some part of it (in this case, the somewhat faulty idea
    that the specific relative token weights of  the words in the books are being
    used as a means of stealing some protectable asset).


    That argument is somewhat tangential, but I''d say that there''s not a whole lot
    of meat on the bone for authors as far as America is concerned. I could be wrong,
    it''s not settled by any stretch and I understand Mosaic wanting to avoid the
    legal costs of, in my opinion, misinformed authors who believe that the method
    of operation of these models is, at once, unknowable in its divinations and clearly
    blatant in its workings as a device of perceived theft.  Moreover, their lack
    of understanding of the accessibility, lack of necessary transparency, and ease
    of making LoRAs and finetunes against very specific datasets underlies the entire
    process. There is and will forever be no practical way of knowing what data any
    given model was trained on and hyper-specific writing-style models can be trained
    in hours or days on a corpus of works without informing anyone and deleted as
    soon as the text anyone needs generated is done. There will never be a way to
    watermark ascii characters, there will never be any way to obfuscate language
    against machine readability without also obfuscating it from human readability.
    It''s a lost fight, in essence. The genie has flown the bottle and is unlikely
    to return even under pressure from governments, who would be grossly unable to
    govern this because they do not need to exist as large, corporate enterprises
    with budgets and head counts. They are relatively small, easily creatable and
    transferrable files. And all of this is on top of the already, to me, unimpressive
    legal argument that a series of float values constitute the legally protectable
    version of their written word. And again, I say this as an author and professional
    writer.


    Anyway, please do link me to some references for those factors for Fair Use in
    international jurisdictions as they sound very specifically relevant to Machine
    Learning applications in their phrasing. No one in my family is a lawyer to the
    best of my knowledge at this time.


    Edit: Also, apologies, I''ll be done there. Not really the spot for the discussion
    I''m sure, but I was having fun.'
