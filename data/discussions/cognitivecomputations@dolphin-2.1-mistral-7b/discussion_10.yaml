        html: '<p>I tested the model with various questions relating to biochemical
          processes, which it answered surprisingly well in content and style.  Pretty
          much like a biology teacher....<br>When I do a database search such as on
          pubmed, the model retrieves seemingly interesting articles and produces
          nice summaries. However, the links provided by the model always point to
          totally unrelated articles or do not exist. Likewise, asking the model to
          download the articles it summarized fails.<br>Is there something I''m missing
          or is this a limitation of the model or its environment (in this case textgen
