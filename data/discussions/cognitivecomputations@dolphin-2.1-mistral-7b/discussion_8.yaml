        html: '<p>hi, I have seen the training args in the files. And have a question
          about the hyper-parameters:<br>the training dataset is ~300k, epoch=4, per_device_train_batch=6,
          and gradient accumulation=4, GPU cards=4, but the global steps=1204, is
          the hyper-parameters correct?</p>

          <p>I am trying to reproduce your results, but I find the metric of ARC and
          Hellaswag decreases significantly during the training.</p>

          <p>Hope to get your reply~<br>Thanks</p>
