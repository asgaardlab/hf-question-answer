        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thanks for sharing your nice work. It is very helpful for my research.
          I''m attempting to reproduce the results with this trained model, but I''m
          confronting some problems reproducing it correctly. Could you please give
          some hints about how to generate the mask and kspace from the fastmri dataset
          using your repository? I would appreciate it if there was a complete script
          for that.</p>

          - if you want to evaluate on test data, then the mask and kspace come directly
          from the fastmri data without any need to generate them.
