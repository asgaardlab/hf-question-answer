        html: '<p>Hello, </p>

          <p>do you have any example prompts and responses of your model. With a GGML
          version from the Bloke, the model performs very bad. See here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/llama-2-13B-German-Assistant-v2-GGML/discussions">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/llama-2-13B-German-Assistant-v2-GGML/discussions</a></p>

          <p>So, I am interested in what you think about the cause of this?<br>Is
          it the GGML conversion that makes it that bad or is the model itself that
          cause that it has such a worse performance?</p>
