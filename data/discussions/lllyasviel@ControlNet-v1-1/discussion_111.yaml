          <ul>

          <li><p>is it possible to have controlnet only influence the result of part
          of an SD image gen? example: i want to define the position of a volleyball
          using a depth map, but i dont want to define the depth of the rest of the
          picture and have it be drawn "freely" instead. is there a way to do this
          by defining areas to ignore (zero control weight)? that would be extremely
          useful.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>is it possible to define a person''s body shape with open pose without
          actually defining the exact pose in the picture? that also would be very
          useful to get the character look you want without depending completely on
          randomness or drastically limiting the possible outcome when you dont want
          to.</p>
