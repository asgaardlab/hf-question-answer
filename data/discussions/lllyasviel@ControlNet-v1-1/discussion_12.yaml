        html: '<p>Right now I''m amazed at what I can do with those models. And I''m
          hungry for more:)<br>In my image creation flow I also create simple clipart,
          flat style images - but when I want to convert them to vector there are
          lots of artifacts<br> and gradients. So there is lots of manual work to
          correct those images. Is it possible to create controlnet model that will
          help generate flat color images with sharp lines between colors? Also to
          flatten gradients so the field of color will be one shade. It would be incredibly
          useful.<br>Thanks, Daniel<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63557dec9c72a7e742f1eacc/-lMUqDRlrHFaJX_4mZpcY.jpeg"><img
