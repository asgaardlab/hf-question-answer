          <p>Which is excellent, basically I''m trying to generate the pose images
          of a person running, and then use those as the input for ControlNet image
          sequence 2 image sequence script v2.</p>

          <p>But damn if I can''t figure out how to output the poses as numbered images.
          The wierd and annoying thing is I managed to do it last night by accident
          and had to copy out all the images. But I can''t do it again!</p>

          <p>Does anyone have any technique for generating just the pose images from
          a collection of frames? Obviously not one at a time.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
