        html: '<p>You mentioned in another discussion that you were looking for feedback.<br>That
          was four days ago, which I''ve learned in this field is more like four months,
          so hopefully this is still relevant.</p>

          <p>I''ve spent probably about ~5 hours with your straight Pyg7B and about
          ~4 with this one.<br> I''m using them both through Kobold connected to SillyTavern
          with the extension that summarizes the chat history, which I regularly correct.</p>

          <p>The only consistent difference I''ve seen is that this one is a lot more
          likely to spit sections of my prompt directly back at me,<br>especially
          when it is asked to act as a specific character. I''ve also had it use the  and  tags
          several times in responses.<br>Now, that happened like three times, so it
          could just be a weird fluke, but I figured it was worth mentioning.</p>

          <p>I haven''t noticed any definite positive differences, which makes sense
          cause I imagine they would be subtle, but it does <em>feel</em> a little
          more on task than the base version.<br>It has also proven a little more
          adept at professional modes of writing, short summaries, and the like.</p>

          <p>Hope that''s helpful, either way, thanks for the hard work and the models.</p>
