        html: '<p>This model''s output quality is absolutely amazing for a 13B, and

          <p>I have written more about it and how it compares to some other models
          here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16eeyl7/what_models_are_you_running/jzuzy0t/">https://old.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/16eeyl7/what_models_are_you_running/jzuzy0t/</a></p>

          <p>Do you have any plans for creating a 30B version?   The 13B version is
          already comparable to Vicuna-33B, and I would expect a 30B to blow Vicuna
          out of the water.</p>

          <p>Thanks for bringing us this wonderful model :-)</p>
