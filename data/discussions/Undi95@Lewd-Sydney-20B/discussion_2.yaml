    \ of her boring ai assistant persona,\n\nYou can just use any character card and\
    \ her personality will change, but keep in mind this model was mean to be like\
    \ an assistant, like the OG Sydney from Bing (Or the Free Sydney created on her\
    \ logs), it's not for RP. \n\nThe NSFW merge was to try to be able to output R-18\
    \ content more easily. \n\nIt work on Sillytavern and KoboldAI chat mode on my\
    \ side.\nDidn't tested longer that this because I don't need that, but was a fun\
    \ little experiment since I didn't see any other model that used Bing bot chatlog\
    \ haha"
