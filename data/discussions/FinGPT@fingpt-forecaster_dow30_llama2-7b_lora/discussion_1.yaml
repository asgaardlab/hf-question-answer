        html: '<p>I''m specifically trying to run the FinGPT demo from the Jupyter
          notebook</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT/blob/master/fingpt/FinGPT_Forecaster/demo.ipynb">https://github.com/AI4Finance-Foundation/FinGPT/blob/master/fingpt/FinGPT_Forecaster/demo.ipynb</a></p>

          <p>on my machine. In that notebook, the 6th cell reads</p>

          <pre><code class="language-py">test_dataset = load_from_disk(<span class="hljs-string">''data/fingpt-forecaster-dow30v3-20221231-20230531-llama/''</span>)[<span
          class="hljs-string">''test''</span>]

          </code></pre>

          <p>and it will of course not work since I don''t have that data on my machine.
          Where can I find it? I''m just trying to have something running on my machine
          so I can start playing with the model.</p>

          <p>Thank you for any help you can provide!</p>
