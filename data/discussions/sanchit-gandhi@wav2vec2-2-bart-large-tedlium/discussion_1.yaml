          <p>Can you please tell me how i can trained a seq2seq model on a custom
          audio dataset ?<br>I have only finetuned Wav2vec2 by following the excellent
          blog by Patrick <a href="https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-wav2vec2-english">https://huggingface.co/blog/fine-tune-wav2vec2-english</a></p>

          <p>Could you please point me to some resource so that i can learn and train
          a seq2seq model like you have done ? </p>

          <p>Thank you </p>
