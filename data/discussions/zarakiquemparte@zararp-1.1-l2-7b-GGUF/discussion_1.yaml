        html: '<p>Xwin models seem to be the new hotness. I''ve played around with
          them and they do seem to have interesting complex story telling prose even
          if their logic and instruct is lacking. This coherency issue is even more
          obvious in the smaller models. </p>

          <p>So I have a complicated request - to BlockMerge_Gradient this with Xwin,
          with Xwin as the prose/creative segment and zararp as the logic/coherency
          segment (possibly with a rebuild version of this using limarp v3). Ignore
          if you will, but I wonder if the combination might finally be the 7b people
          are looking for. Ignore me if you like, just a silly pleb request!</p>

          <p>If you make it, you could call it ''ZARAX''</p>
