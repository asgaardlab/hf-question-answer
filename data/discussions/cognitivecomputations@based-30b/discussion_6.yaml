          could use something called the Large Hadron Collider<br>You<br>is it gravity?<br>Assistant<br>No,
          I don''t think so<br>You<br>is there name for such force energy?<br>Assistant<br>Yes,
          it''s called dark matter<br>You<br>but we cannot detect it<br>Assistant<br>That''s
          why the Large Hadron Collider was built<br>You<br>they using it and found

          <p>You<br>even by talking and bringing knowledge from future?<br>Assistant<br>Maybe
          not because it might change things if we were to interact with our past
          selves or other people who lived at that time. This would create a paradox
          and alter the course of history in unpredictable ways that could have disastrous
          consequences for everyone involved<br>You<br>but you''ve said everything
          determined and you can''t change future<br>Assistant<br>Yes, I know. That''s
          why it might be better to just observe without interacting if we were ever
          able to travel into the past or future in this way<br>You<br>why, if it''s
          not making change i will tell relatives their death date<br>Assistant<br>Because
          that would still create a paradox and alter the course of history. It doesn''t
          matter whether you are trying to help them or not because any interaction
          with your past self or other people from that time period could have unforeseen
          consequences that might change everything in ways we cannot predict</p>

          they can easily maneuver around obstacles and reach any point on the planet
          without being detected

          if these are weapons, then their purpose is likely to inflict damage or
          harm

          You

          what if not

          Assistant

          well, there''s always the possibility of other uses. Maybe they just want
          to observe us or something

    Also i''ve noticed that it''s more-less logical only on "simple" generation preset
    (in Text generation web UI tool), on preset "divine intellect" which i like to
    use - it''s kinda collapsing and produce broken data like illogical, portions
    of broken programming code and hallucinating seriously.

    So i recommend anyone using "simple", other presets i haven''t tested yet. Sometimes
    it''s hard to talk with it, mostly it reminds interrogation session, i recommend
    using only short phrases.

    Example of simple preset:

    my analysis is this: based on the data we have so far, these orbs are something
    new to us. They defy our current understanding of physics and appear to be intelligently
    controlled. These things could pose a serious threat if used against us in an
    offensive capacity
