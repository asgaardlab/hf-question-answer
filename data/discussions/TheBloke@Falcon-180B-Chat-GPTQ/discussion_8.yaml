          <p>It does have the original 180B parameters, quantised.  But possibly they''re
          stored in a different way, that makes it appear like there''s fewer?  Sorry,
          I''m a bit hazy on the technical details of how the model is stored once
          quantised.  Or it might just be that the indicator is incorrect for quantised
          models, mis-reading the structure.</p>

          <p>But yes, it''s definitely the whole model!</p>
