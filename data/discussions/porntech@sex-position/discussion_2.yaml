        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for your interest, the model is trained with the training
          script in mmpretrain, you can find the script in mmpretrain github repo,
          so there is no source code, just mmpretrain, I used the config file for
          resnet50, you can easily find the config file in the same github repo, the
          most important part is not the model but the data, you have to collect large
          amount of data using spiders like scrapy. For the reasons you must know,
          I can not share the data, sorry for that.</p>
