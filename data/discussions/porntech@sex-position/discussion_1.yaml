          <p>Hi, thanks for you interest. You can follow the instruction of hf to
          run the inference, for the dataset, I crawled large amount of image(more
          than 100k for each class), I did''t annotate them with my self instead use
          the tags for the image as label so the labels are noisy and the performance
          is not that good. I''m currently focusing on action classification, if action
          classification can achieve good accuracy then I will further improve the
          image classification model</p>
