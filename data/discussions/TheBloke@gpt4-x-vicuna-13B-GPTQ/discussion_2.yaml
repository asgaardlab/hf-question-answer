        html: '<p>Hey there!</p>

          <p>So when I work with LLMs, I sometimes have a pretty long context I try
          to feed into my models. Now, what confuses me about this model is (and mind
          you, I am still learning all of this): the model_max_length is 512 tokens,
          while the max_position_embeddings are 2048 tokens. </p>

          <p>Does that mean the model itself supports 2048 tokens but the tokenizer
          can only encode 512 tokens max? Would there be a way to switch out the tokenizer
          so that it can feed the full 2048 tokens the model supports? Or am I missing
          something?</p>
