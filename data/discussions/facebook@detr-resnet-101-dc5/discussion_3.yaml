        html: '<p>Hi everyone,</p>

          <p>I''m encountering a technical hitch with DETR (DEtection TRansformer)
          using ResNet-101-DC5 on the Hugging Face platform. When I try to run a test,
          I get the following error message:</p>

          <p>Failed to import transformers.models.detr.modeling_detr because of the
          following error (look up to see its traceback): mutable default &lt;class
          ''timm.models.maxxvit.MaxxVitConvCfg''&gt; for field conv_cfg is not allowed:
          use default_factory.</p>

          <p>I''m not quite sure what''s causing this or how to fix it. Has anyone
          else faced this issue or can offer some guidance on how to resolve it? Any
          advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot in advance for your help!</p>
