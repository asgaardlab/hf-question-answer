        html: '<p>Hello Mr. Rishav,</p>

          <p>Hope this finds you well!</p>

          <p>I am very interested in using (switch transformer classification) in
          a text classification problem.</p>

          <p>But I always had a problem with the AutoTokenizer.</p>

          <p>So, I was using the tokenizer for Bert classification model.</p>

          <p>But we face another problem, which is the availability of ( config.json
          not found in HuggingFace Hub ).</p>

          <p>Can you please upload the full model please so that I can use the AutoTokenizer
          and its weights!</p>

          <p>So, we don''t want to build it from scratch again.</p>
