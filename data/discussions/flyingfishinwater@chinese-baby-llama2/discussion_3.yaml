          <p>Very nice and exciting project! What I''m particularly curious about
          is the model size.<br>If it''s a model with only around 58 million parameters.
          We may expect the resulting checkpoint might take 232 MB as you use float32
          for parameter. Why is the resulting PyTorch model file so big, around 843
          MB ? </p>
