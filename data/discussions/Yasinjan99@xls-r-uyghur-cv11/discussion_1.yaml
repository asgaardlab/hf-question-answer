        html: '<p>Hi brother!</p>

          <p>Firstly, I''d like to express my gratitude for your contributions to
          the speech recognition field in Uyghur ASR technology. Your work is really
          helpful for beginners like me in this field.</p>

          <p>I have some foundational knowledge about ASR from past attempts at training
          a Chinese ASR model. Now I am interested in building Uyghur ASR. However,
          I am not a professional in neither of machine learning nor data scientist,
          it is difficult for me to train it myself without instructions.</p>

          <p>I wonder whether if you could provide some instructional material, like
          a video tutorial or a blog post, on how to train an ASR model for the Uyghur
          language using Common Voice. A beginner-friendly guide or documentation
          would be really helpful for beginners like me.</p>

          <p>Thank you once again for your efforts. I look forward to possibly discussing
          more advanced topics with you in the future as I progress in my learning.</p>

          <p>I wish you more success in your research and career!</p>
