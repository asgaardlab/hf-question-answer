          write a paper and post to Arxiv on this topic and significant contribution

          and encoding representations ?</p>

          <p>However since the model seems to be having some limited self correction
          and guard rails, and the model has limited cleanup of personally-identifiable
          information it should be mentioned in the announcement and user guide. There
          should be more guard rails added to this model and harmful content generation
          should be listed.</p>

          <p>Thank you<br>-Muthu Annamalai</p>
