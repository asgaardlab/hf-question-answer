        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for this model!</p>

          <p>I''m looking for a model which has been trained on images from the public
          domain, exclusively. Or images carrying a similar license.</p>

          <p>In the description of this model it says:</p>

          <p>"This model was trained on a curated dataset of roughly 300 images hand-picked
          from Midjourney, Prompt Hero, PixaBay, Open Journey V2, and Reddit."</p>

          <p>So, I wonder, were these images picked with this in mind?</p>

          <p>Regards,<br>Ulf</p>

        html: '<p>Hi Ulf!</p>

          <p>All images used for training are either ai-generated or public domain
          (CC0 license). I have not checked if the ai-generated images are released
          under CC0 or a similar license. If you want a model that uses only public
          domain images, I recommend <a href="https://huggingface.co/Mitsua/mitsua-diffusion-one">Mitsua
          Diffusion One</a>.</p>

          <p>Oh, and I''m working on an innovative text-to-image model architecture
          that is trained using only CC0 images. I estimate that this model can achieve
          higher image quality than SDXL 1.0 in terms of image naturalness while using
          25%-50% less VRAM and running 200%-250% faster.</p>

          <p>Hope that helped!</p>

        html: '<p>Hi Fred, and thank you so much for your answer! </p>

          <p>I''ll having a look at the Mitsua model, it seems to be what I''m searching
          for. I''m new to data science and ML and there''s a lot of new stuff to
          digest. </p>

          <p>Am a bit surprised that not more art models are built on CC0-only images.
          For example Steam, the world''s biggest games publisher, is actively rejecting
          games which include AI art that the creator cannot claim legal use of, so
          there should be use cases already. </p>

          <p>I sure will stay tuned for your new model, it looks exciting!</p>

          <p>Thanks again,<br>Ulf</p>
