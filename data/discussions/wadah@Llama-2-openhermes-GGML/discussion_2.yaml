        html: '<p>If the models in this repository are named after their quantisation
          correctly, then they are quite fast, almost twice as fast in comparison
          to <a href="https://huggingface.co/s3nh/teknium-OpenHermes-13B-GGUF/tree/main">https://huggingface.co/s3nh/teknium-OpenHermes-13B-GGUF/tree/main</a></p>

          <p>In addition: way less RAM is required to utilize this model release.</p>

          <p><strong>Update:</strong><br>And finally the size seems to suggest that
          this might be the <strong>7b version of OpenHermes and not 13b</strong>
          like the one mentioned before.<br>So this is not suprising at all that it
          is very fast at generating tokens.<br>This specific release aside, what''s
          really surprising is how well it performs in story telling, at least as
          I''m currently testing it.</p>
