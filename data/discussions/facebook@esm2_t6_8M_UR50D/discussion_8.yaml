        html: '<p>Hi, I''m using the TF implementation and I want to know if there''s
          a way to constrain the vocabulary size to the common 20 amino acids but
          without using my own config class, I mean by loading the pre-trained weights.  Also,
          I don''t understand what are the additional characters in the vocabulary
          list.</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance!<br>Best regards, Dani.</p>
