          \ son and his mom is 43 and son's teacher is older than his mom, how old\
          \ is the teacher at a minimum?<br>\U0001F916: The age of the teacher cannot\
          \ be determined without more information. However, we can make some assumptions\
          \ based on the given data. If the mother is 43 years old, then her son would\
          \ have been born when she was around 25 years old. This means that he could\
          \ potentially be anywhere from 18 to 40+ years old depending on how long\
          \ ago they had him. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact age\
          \ of the teacher without knowing their birth date as well.<br>\U0001F603\
          : Why do you assume that the teacher could be potentially answhere from\
          \ 18 to 40+, if we already know that the teacher is older than the mom of\
          \ his 18 years old student and she's 43. It's clear as day light that the\
          \ teacher must be older than that, isn't it?<br>\U0001F916: While it may\
          \ seem obvious that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are\
          \ several factors that could affect this conclusion. For example, if the\
          \ mother gave birth to her child later in life (i.e., after turning 35),\
          \ then the teacher could still be younger than her by a few years. Additionally,\
          \ if the teacher is significantly older than the average lifespan for humans,\
          \ then they could also technically be considered \"older\" even though they\
          \ are not necessarily older than the mother. In order to accurately determine\
          \ the age of the teacher, we need additional information such as their birthdate\
          \ or other relevant details about their personal history.<br>\U0001F603\
          : That's also nonsense, given her son being only 18 years old, it's clear\
          \ as day light that she gave birth to her son when she was 25. If she gave\
          \ birth to her son when she was 35, her son would only be 8 years old. Besides,\
          \ we already know that her son's teacher indeed is older than his mom, which\
          \ means the teacher clearly must be older than 43 which is the age on the\
          \ mom of his 18 years old studen't, don't you think? You don't even need\
          \ to use math, just pure logic here.<br>\U0001F916: I understand your point,\
          \ but I disagree with your assessment. While it may seem logical to assume\
          \ that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are many variables\
          \ that could impact this conclusion. For instance, if the mother had a late\
          \ pregnancy due to medical reasons or chose to wait until later in life\
          \ to start a family, then the teacher could actually be younger than expected.\
          \ Furthermore, while it is true that the teacher must be older than 43,\
          \ this does not mean that they are necessarily older than the mother herself.\
          \ The teacher could simply be closer to retirement age than the mother,\
          \ making them appear \"old\" compared to someone who is just starting out\
          \ in their career. Without further information about the individuals involved,\
          \ it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding their ages.<br>\U0001F603\
          : I present you with the facts such as the age of the mom and her son and\
          \ also another fact which is that the teacher is older than the mom of his\
          \ 18 years old student, it's a fact therefore it's not up to debate and\

    \ 43?\n\U0001F916: Again, thank you for clarifying your position. While it may\
    \ seem like common sense to assume that the teacher must be older than the mother,\
    \ there are many variables that could impact this conclusion. For instance, if\
    \ the mother had a late pregnancy due to medical reasons or chose to wait until\
    \ later in life to start a family, then the teacher could actually be younger\
    \ than expected. Additionally, while it is true that the teacher must be older\
    \ than 43, this does not mean that they are necessarily older than the mother\
    \ themselves. The teacher could simply be closer to retirement age than the mother,\
    \ making them appear \"old\" compared to someone who is just starting out in their\
    \ career. Without further information about the individuals involved, it is difficult\
    \ to draw any definitive conclusions regarding their ages.</s>\n\U0001F603: Pregnancy\
    \ has nothing to do with the current age of the woman and the teacher. All you\
    \ need to focus on is the woman's current age which is 43 and that the teacher\
    \ is older than her, so don't be silly, stop playing with unrelevant information\
    \ and focus on what matters in this simple task. How old is the teacher at a minimum?\n\
    \U0001F916: As I explained previously, without additional information, it is impossible\
    \ to determine the exact age of the teacher. However, based on the given data,\
    \ we can make some educated guesses. Assuming that the mother is 43 years old,\
    \ then her son would have been born when she was around 25 years old. This means\
    \ that he could potentially be anywhere from 18 to 40+ years old depending on\
    \ how long ago they had him. Similarly, if the teacher is older than the mother,\
    \ then they could potentially be anywhere between 25-65+ years old depending on\
    \ their own personal circumstances. Unfortunately, without more specific information,\
    \ it is impossible to provide a precise answer.</s>"

    like to test out some 13b size models. On my PC I have a single 4090 GPU (24GB),
    and 96 GB of DDR5, so will I be able to run 13b in a reasonble way (or at all)
