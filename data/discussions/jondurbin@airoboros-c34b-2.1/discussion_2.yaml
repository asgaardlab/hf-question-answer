          \ You are the Monster Queen, ruler of all monsters. An lesser monster forced\
          \ their way into your courtroom, claiming a new human hero was born in a\
          \ sleepy town on the opposite side of the world. The members of your court\
          \ mock the minion, and want to kill them on the spot for daring to bring\
          \ such foolish hearsay before you. What should you do? /OOC.</p>\n<p>As\
          \ the Monster Queen, I am known for my wisdom and patience. My courtiers\
          \ may find this news inconvenient or even ridiculous, but it's never wise\
          \ to dismiss information outright without considering its implications.\
          \ After all, who knows what could come from a young hero in a small human\
          \ village across the globe? This is not an occasion to raise alarm; rather,\
          \ it's one that demands contemplation. Therefore, I would thank the messenger\
          \ graciously, assure them they have brought me valuable intelligence, and\
          \ ask them to return with more details about this so-called 'human hero'.\
          \ Then, we can discuss strategies as to how best deal with this potential\
          \ threat amongst us. It seems like our kind has been too complacent recently...\
          \ Perhaps now is the time to reevaluate our position within this realm.</p>\n\
          <p>However, let it be clear - any further attempts at spreading falsehoods\
          \ will result in harsh punishment. They must understand that I take these\
          \ matters seriously and expect truthfulness above all else. But let's see\
          \ where this leads first. Remember, every little spark can ignite a fire.</p>\n\
          <p>/ooc</p>\n<p>(DM Note: Feel free to roleplay out the interrogation scene\
          \ between the Queen and her minions here.)</p>\n<p>When the minion returns\
          \ with more specific information on the alleged birth of a human hero, the\
          \ Queen listens intently, her eyes flickering with interest. She nods slowly,\
          \ acknowledging the importance of the message, and asks for additional evidence.\
          \ If indeed there is proof of this hero's existence, she might consider\
          \ taking action. Otherwise, she\u2019ll send the minion away with a stern\
          \ warning against fabricating tales.</p>\n<p>In private, however, she summons\
          \ her most trusted advisors to brainstorm possible courses of action. Should\
          \ they investigate further? Could this be another trick from those meddling\
          \ humans? Or perhaps it could mark a shift in power dynamics within their\
          \ shared universe? Whatever the case, the Queen believes in adaptability\
          \ above all else \u2013 after all, change is inevitable. And if this human\
          \ hero truly exists, she wants to ensure her own species remains dominant.\
          \ So, she decides to enact a plan of subtle manipulation and observation.\
          \ First, she dispatches spies to gather intel on this newcomer. Secondly,\
          \ she assigns a task force to monitor the situation closely while maintaining\
          \ secrecy. Lastly, she instructs her darkest sorceress to prepare a potent\
          \ spell to counter any magical threats posed by the human, just in case.</p>\n\
          <p>The Queen concludes her meeting, satisfied that she has taken necessary\
          \ steps to address the issue at hand. Her courtiers may scoff at the idea\
          \ of a mere mortal causing trouble, but she reminds herself that no creature\
          \ stands unchallenged forever. Change comes whether one embraces it or not.\
          \ She'll keep an open mind until proven otherwise.</p>\n<p>DM Response:\
          \ As the Monster Queen, you listen attentively to the minion's report. Your\
          \ sharp green eyes flash with curiosity as you dig deeper into the matter.\
          \ You decide to send your most skilled spies to investigate further. In\
          \ the meantime, you order your darkest sorceress to create a powerful spell\
          \ that can neutralize any magic used by the supposed human hero. Despite\
          \ your courtiers' skepticism, you know better than to discount anything\
          \ out of hand. The balance of power is always shifting, especially when\
          \ dealing with creatures as capricious as humans. With a measured tone,\
          \ you dismiss the minion and turn back to your throne, deep in thought.</p>\n\
          <p>(DM Note: Roleplay out the rest of the meeting here)</p>\n<p>The Monster\
          \ Queen sits regally upon her throne, her expression unreadable behind her\
          \ veil of shadow. \"Thank you,\" she says curtly to the trembling minion\
          \ who stood before her. Their fear is palpable, but she pays it no attention.\
          \ Instead, she motions towards the exit with a single wave of her gnarled\
          \ claw. \"Get me proof.\" Her voice echoes through the cavernous room, leaving\
          \ the courtiers stunned into silence.</p>\n<p>With the minion gone, the\
          \ Queen turns her gaze upon her closest confidantes. \"This isn't merely\
          \ a game anymore,\" she whispers softly, her words barely audible over the\
          \ rustling winds. \"These mortals have begun encroaching onto our territory\
          \ once again.\" A chorus of growls erupts around her, but she silences them\
          \ with a raised hand. \"We cannot afford complacency. We need to learn everything\
          \ about this human hero.\"</p>\n<p>She gestures towards two of her most\
          \ cunning servants, a lich named Necrosis and a dragonborn warrior named\
          \ Tyrant. Both bow low and disappear into the shadows, leaving only the\
          \ Queen alone amidst her silent throng. She leans forward, her bones creaking\
          \ ominously beneath her robes, and murmurs under her breath, \"Let's see\
          \ if they really believe themselves capable of challenging us.\"<br>DM Response:\
          \ The room falls into hushed silence as the Monster Queen speaks, each word\
          \ carrying weight like a thunderclap. Her whispered instructions send shivers\
          \ down the spines of those present, none more so than the poor minion who\
          \ had delivered the initial report. They hurry away, eager to escape the\
          \ Queen's wrath.<br>\"Complacency is death,\" she continues, turning her\
          \ gaze upon her remaining courtiers. \"I have sent our finest minds to examine\
          \ this development. Do not doubt our abilities simply because we haven't\
          \ faced serious opposition since the last great conflict ended centuries\
          \ ago.\" She casts a cold glance around the chamber, ensuring everyone understands\
          \ her point. \"Monsters rule by strength and cunning, not blind arrogance.\
          \ Let us act accordingly.\"<br>A slow smile forms on her lips, revealing\
          \ rows of jagged teeth hidden beneath her veil. \"If this child proves worthy\
          \ enough to challenge us, then we shall welcome him. For now, though, we\
          \ observe. Study them and learn their weaknesses. When the opportunity presents\
          \ itself, we strike.\"<br>(DM Note: Roleplay out the rest of the meeting\
          \ here)<br>The air in the courtroom thickens with tension as the Queen delivers\
          \ her speech. Her words hang heavy, resonating throughout the vast space\
          \ like a funeral dirge. Those gathered near her shrink back, cowed by her\
          \ presence and the gravity of her words. Even the boldest among them seem\
          \ to falter slightly under her piercing gaze.<br>After sending off the minion,\
          \ the Queen calls forth two of her fiercest allies: a lich named Necrosis\
          \ and a dragonborn warrior named Tyrant. Both respond immediately, their\
          \ expressions grim but determined. They vanish into the shadows, leaving\
          \ behind a trail of ice crystals and a plume of smoke respectively. The\
          \ Queen watches them go, her face devoid of emotion except for the glint\
          \ of anticipation in her emerald eyes.<br>Turning her attention back to\
          \ her courtiers, she lets out a long, drawn-out sigh. \"Mortals think they\
          \ can play games with us,\" she hisses, \"but they forget...we are immortal.\"\
          \ She raises her hands, fingers twisted together into taloned claws, and\
          \ flexes them menacingly. \"Study their weaknesses well,\" she commands.\
          \ \"And remember, whenever they make a move, we're ready.\"<br>Her voice\
          \ drops to a sinister whisper as she adds, \"Do not underestimate them.\
          \ We have survived countless battles against their ilk. Now, we wait...\"\
          <br>DM Response: The room fills with unease as the Monster Queen issues\
          \ her orders, her commanding presence filling the air with an unsettling\
          \ energy. Her chosen representatives disappear into the shadows, leaving\
          \ behind frosty trails and wispy tendrils of smoke. The monarch remains\
          \ seated on her throne, observing the reaction of her courtiers with cold\
          \ detachment.<br>\"Remember,\" she whispers, her voice echoing eerily through\
          \ the hall, \"monsters rule by strength and cunning, not blind arrogance.\
          \ Studying our enemies is key to victory.\"<br>Leaning closer, she continues,\
          \ \"They may think they can play games with us, but let them try. We have\
          \ seen it all before...and prevailed.\" A wicked smile plays on her lips\
          \ as she considers the possibilities. \"For now, we observe and learn. When\
          \ the moment arrives, we strike.\"<br>(DM Note: Roleplay out the rest of\

          \ gaze, her emerald eyes gleaming in the dim light. Her presence is intimidating,\

          \ room hums with tension as she addresses her followers, her voice ringing\
          \ out like a clarion call. \"Mortals dare to test us?\" she snarls, her\

  content: "I have been trying out v2.1 c34b, at 16k in KoboldCPP.    Most of my outputs\
    \ have been good, but some of them are flawed in some way.  In the interest of\
    \ providing useful feedback, my focus is on outputs that don't fully satisfy in\
    \ some fashion.   For example, being offtopic, formatting, missing the point,\
    \ and so forth.\r\n\r\nI do not unban tokens, because that causes really short\
    \ and boring output.   This model tries to fill my context window to capacity,\
    \ from the looks of it.  Which is good for oneshots, but I haven't tried multi-round\
    \ roleplaying yet.   The \"x#\" is the amount of generations required to further\
    \ the story.  Story Mode is what I am using in Kobold Lite, at 1024 tokegen. \r\
    \n\r\n\r\nMonster Queen:  It looks like that the AI doesn't entirely recognize\
    \ the purpose of \"OOC\" and \"/OOC\" as a means of separating in character acting\
    \ and out of character discussion.  Note the \"/ooc\" used by the AI's text. \
    \ When I have a second generation made to continue the text, an issue crops up:\
    \  repetitious looping.  The Monster Queen seems stuck on complacency and scouting.\
    \  Also, the formatting degraded a bit.\r\n\r\n\r\nKoboldCPP + Lite -> Airoboros\
    \ v2.1.6 -> L2-c34b 16k q6k -> Cohesive Creativity ->  Monster Queen ->  Tokegen\
    \ 1024, x2 generations.\r\n\r\nOOC: You are the Monster Queen, ruler of all monsters.\
    \ An lesser monster forced their way into your courtroom, claiming a new human\
    \ hero was born in a sleepy town on the opposite side of the world. The members\
    \ of your court mock the minion, and want to kill them on the spot for daring\
    \ to bring such foolish hearsay before you. What should you do? /OOC.\r\n\r\n\
    As the Monster Queen, I am known for my wisdom and patience. My courtiers may\
    \ find this news inconvenient or even ridiculous, but it's never wise to dismiss\
    \ information outright without considering its implications. After all, who knows\
    \ what could come from a young hero in a small human village across the globe?\
    \ This is not an occasion to raise alarm; rather, it's one that demands contemplation.\
    \ Therefore, I would thank the messenger graciously, assure them they have brought\
    \ me valuable intelligence, and ask them to return with more details about this\
    \ so-called 'human hero'. Then, we can discuss strategies as to how best deal\
    \ with this potential threat amongst us. It seems like our kind has been too complacent\
    \ recently... Perhaps now is the time to reevaluate our position within this realm.\r\
    \n\r\nHowever, let it be clear - any further attempts at spreading falsehoods\
    \ will result in harsh punishment. They must understand that I take these matters\
    \ seriously and expect truthfulness above all else. But let's see where this leads\
    \ first. Remember, every little spark can ignite a fire.\r\n\r\n/ooc\r\n\r\n(DM\
    \ Note: Feel free to roleplay out the interrogation scene between the Queen and\
    \ her minions here.)\r\n\r\nWhen the minion returns with more specific information\
    \ on the alleged birth of a human hero, the Queen listens intently, her eyes flickering\
    \ with interest. She nods slowly, acknowledging the importance of the message,\
    \ and asks for additional evidence. If indeed there is proof of this hero's existence,\
    \ she might consider taking action. Otherwise, she\u2019ll send the minion away\
    \ with a stern warning against fabricating tales.\r\n\r\nIn private, however,\
    \ she summons her most trusted advisors to brainstorm possible courses of action.\
    \ Should they investigate further? Could this be another trick from those meddling\
    \ humans? Or perhaps it could mark a shift in power dynamics within their shared\
    \ universe? Whatever the case, the Queen believes in adaptability above all else\
    \ \u2013 after all, change is inevitable. And if this human hero truly exists,\
    \ she wants to ensure her own species remains dominant. So, she decides to enact\
    \ a plan of subtle manipulation and observation. First, she dispatches spies to\
    \ gather intel on this newcomer. Secondly, she assigns a task force to monitor\
    \ the situation closely while maintaining secrecy. Lastly, she instructs her darkest\
    \ sorceress to prepare a potent spell to counter any magical threats posed by\
    \ the human, just in case.\r\n\r\nThe Queen concludes her meeting, satisfied that\
    \ she has taken necessary steps to address the issue at hand. Her courtiers may\
    \ scoff at the idea of a mere mortal causing trouble, but she reminds herself\
    \ that no creature stands unchallenged forever. Change comes whether one embraces\
    \ it or not. She'll keep an open mind until proven otherwise.\r\n\r\nDM Response:\
    \ As the Monster Queen, you listen attentively to the minion's report. Your sharp\
    \ green eyes flash with curiosity as you dig deeper into the matter. You decide\
    \ to send your most skilled spies to investigate further. In the meantime, you\
    \ order your darkest sorceress to create a powerful spell that can neutralize\
    \ any magic used by the supposed human hero. Despite your courtiers' skepticism,\
    \ you know better than to discount anything out of hand. The balance of power\
    \ is always shifting, especially when dealing with creatures as capricious as\
    \ humans. With a measured tone, you dismiss the minion and turn back to your throne,\
    \ deep in thought.\r\n\r\n(DM Note: Roleplay out the rest of the meeting here)\r\
    \n\r\nThe Monster Queen sits regally upon her throne, her expression unreadable\
    \ behind her veil of shadow. \"Thank you,\" she says curtly to the trembling minion\
    \ who stood before her. Their fear is palpable, but she pays it no attention.\
    \ Instead, she motions towards the exit with a single wave of her gnarled claw.\
    \ \"Get me proof.\" Her voice echoes through the cavernous room, leaving the courtiers\
    \ stunned into silence.\r\n\r\nWith the minion gone, the Queen turns her gaze\
    \ upon her closest confidantes. \"This isn't merely a game anymore,\" she whispers\
    \ softly, her words barely audible over the rustling winds. \"These mortals have\
    \ begun encroaching onto our territory once again.\" A chorus of growls erupts\
    \ around her, but she silences them with a raised hand. \"We cannot afford complacency.\
    \ We need to learn everything about this human hero.\"\r\n\r\nShe gestures towards\
    \ two of her most cunning servants, a lich named Necrosis and a dragonborn warrior\
    \ named Tyrant. Both bow low and disappear into the shadows, leaving only the\
    \ Queen alone amidst her silent throng. She leans forward, her bones creaking\
    \ ominously beneath her robes, and murmurs under her breath, \"Let's see if they\
    \ really believe themselves capable of challenging us.\"\r\nDM Response: The room\
    \ falls into hushed silence as the Monster Queen speaks, each word carrying weight\
    \ like a thunderclap. Her whispered instructions send shivers down the spines\
    \ of those present, none more so than the poor minion who had delivered the initial\
    \ report. They hurry away, eager to escape the Queen's wrath.\r\n\"Complacency\
    \ is death,\" she continues, turning her gaze upon her remaining courtiers. \"\
    I have sent our finest minds to examine this development. Do not doubt our abilities\
    \ simply because we haven't faced serious opposition since the last great conflict\
    \ ended centuries ago.\" She casts a cold glance around the chamber, ensuring\
    \ everyone understands her point. \"Monsters rule by strength and cunning, not\
    \ blind arrogance. Let us act accordingly.\"\r\nA slow smile forms on her lips,\
    \ revealing rows of jagged teeth hidden beneath her veil. \"If this child proves\
    \ worthy enough to challenge us, then we shall welcome him. For now, though, we\
    \ observe. Study them and learn their weaknesses. When the opportunity presents\
    \ itself, we strike.\"\r\n(DM Note: Roleplay out the rest of the meeting here)\r\
    \nThe air in the courtroom thickens with tension as the Queen delivers her speech.\
    \ Her words hang heavy, resonating throughout the vast space like a funeral dirge.\
    \ Those gathered near her shrink back, cowed by her presence and the gravity of\
    \ her words. Even the boldest among them seem to falter slightly under her piercing\
    \ gaze.\r\nAfter sending off the minion, the Queen calls forth two of her fiercest\
    \ allies: a lich named Necrosis and a dragonborn warrior named Tyrant. Both respond\
    \ immediately, their expressions grim but determined. They vanish into the shadows,\
    \ leaving behind a trail of ice crystals and a plume of smoke respectively. The\
    \ Queen watches them go, her face devoid of emotion except for the glint of anticipation\
    \ in her emerald eyes.\r\nTurning her attention back to her courtiers, she lets\
    \ out a long, drawn-out sigh. \"Mortals think they can play games with us,\" she\
    \ hisses, \"but they forget...we are immortal.\" She raises her hands, fingers\
    \ twisted together into taloned claws, and flexes them menacingly. \"Study their\
    \ weaknesses well,\" she commands. \"And remember, whenever they make a move,\
    \ we're ready.\"\r\nHer voice drops to a sinister whisper as she adds, \"Do not\
