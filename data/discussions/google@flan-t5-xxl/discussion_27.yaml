        html: '<p>I''ve been a huge fan of the Flan T5 models since about last two
          weeks.</p>

          <p>When I compare performance of each against eachother, here are some notes
          on what test inputs work with which models and which appear to have limitations..</p>

          <p>Prompt Test:  In order to reduce symptoms of asthma such as tightness
          in the chest, wheezing, and difficulty breathing, what do you recommend?</p>

          <p>Responses by model:</p>

          <ol>

          <li><p>google/flan-t5-xxl: Never completes - it looks like model attempts
          to load but times out.  Can you fix that maybe with more memory in the container
          running it?  Also is there any limit to input/output size?  Something prevents
          this one from working right on HF platform.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>google/flan-t5-large: Answer: take ibuprofen</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>google/flan-t5-xl: Answer: avoiding allergens and avoiding triggers.  (best
          answer)</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>google/flan-t5-base: Answer: avoiding smoking (great advice generally)</p>

          </li>

          </ol>

          <p>Is it possible to get a working version of the XXL flan T5 working correctly
          and performant?  This is a really great feature of the AI community that
          you are sharing these with the public open source based world!  Kudos on
          your hard work and beauty in the model design and development. </p>

          <p>Thanks for one of the best models out there for general QA, solution
          step answering and also PubMedQA which are important to me.  Also thanks
          for the prompt examples with the patterns of sequence for hinting at how
          to prompt to elicit the general NLP capabilities.  Much appreciated!</p>
