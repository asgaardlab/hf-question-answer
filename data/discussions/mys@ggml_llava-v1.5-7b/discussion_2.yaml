        html: '<p>Hello,<br>First of all, ty for your contributions to this community.
          I''ve been very excited to be able to use the Llava model because of the
          files you uploaded. I wanted to make a request - would it be possible for
          you to help with the Llavar conversion? Llavar is a very promising Llava
          variant that appears to do text recognition quite well: <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://llavar.github.io/">https://llavar.github.io/</a></p>

          <p>I''ve started a discussion thread on Llama.cpp, with details of my approach.
          </p>

          <p>I''m not sure if a conversion is not possible yet or it''s user error
          on my part:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/3875">https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/discussions/3875</a></p>

          <p>Any assistance you could provide would greatly aid me and I''m sure others
          who are struggling with this.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
