          <p>I get this :( I notice a little bump in RAM but nothing happens. Any
          idea why? Any tips? I am using the -no act model, and the vicuna 7b loads
          if I set my page file size to 100 gb.</p>

          <p>Update: I download the .pt model from this post:<br><a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ/discussions/6#644b1a6e3a619fe72b17af1e">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ/discussions/6#644b1a6e3a619fe72b17af1e</a><br>that
          model works but not the .safetensors file...<br>So if anyone is having the
          same problem use the .pt file :)</p>

          have just downloaded and try the compat.no-act-order.safetensors one, to
          be sure, but it doesn''t load. Again a small bump in RAM but just that.
          It is like it is trying to load it but then the process stops. It is very
          strange, but yes, I think the program just want .pt files and hates .safetensors
          hahahahaha filefobic... Have a great day! Thank you for your time and don''t
          stop converting models :)</p>
