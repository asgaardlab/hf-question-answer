        html: '<p>Oh, I should have mentioned that I have set up a handful of pretty
          difficult test scenarios that I run each new model at, not just {{char}}
          talking to {{user}}. I expect the AI to roleplay AIs, machines without body
          or arms, entities who cannot speak, very difficult anatomies or confusing
          gender role swaps, or whole open world scenarios with various characters
          to roleplay at the same time. And I expect the models to act by themselves,
          to drive the story, to be creative, not to rush or summarize lewd scenes,
          and so on. Most models fail miserably at these difficult tasks, obviously.</p>

          <p>Actually MLewd 2-3 was the very first local model that successfully mastered
          the scenario with the machine, with very few mistakes. It still wanted to
          grin, for example. q4 had trouble, q8 did it, finally! The only other AI
          which ever did well on this challenging scenario was ChatGPT 3.5. So you
          might understand now, why I am so obsessed with MLewd 2-3. ;-) The other
          MLewd models weren''t bad, but none reached the success rate of 2-3 on difficult
          scenarios. 2-4 is even horrible compared to it, although it creates good
          stories. </p>

          <p>When you released MXLewd 20b, it has blown me away in the 16bit version
          on 8k. This is the by far best (lewd) RP Model I have ever tried, ChatGPT
          included!! (I should add this in my comment to this model) Kobold Horde
          supported it for some days now, so I had the pleasure to test it in deep,
          and I am in love with your model. It is so intelligent, thoughtful, understanding.
          So, sorry, but every new model has now to compete against this gold standard.
          Emerhyst, which is hosted on Horde right now in 16bit, is a close second
          place, but with the named flaw which happens sometimes. </p>

          <p>I discussed my prompt deeply with MXLewd. When it behaved different to
          what I expected, I asked for a self analysis, why it interpreted the prompt
          the way it did, with outstanding results. It even explained how sensible
          it could react to the tone of formulations or my choice of words. Actually
          I am running on complex prompts which are designed 80% by MXLewd, and wich
          did exceptionally good with MXLewd. </p>

          <p>The problem I''ve reported on Emerhyst  happens in open world scenarios,
          where it tends to start story telling. I will try your sentence against
          this behavior. This means, that the AI has to understand which of the several
          characters are the AI''s ones, and which one not to play. Even more difficult,
          the AI is allowed to describe physical sensations, {{user}} is experiencing,
          but still shall not act consciously. You might think, that''s way too hard
          for a local AI model nowadays, but MXLewd mastered it with my prompts except
          for very rare mistakes.</p>

          <p>For example, this is a reminder I inject at depth 4 in an open world
          scenario: [Important: You only act {{char}}''s characters! Refrain from
          speaking or acting for {{user}}. Instead, focus on describing the sensations
          and physical experiences {{user}} is undergoing, including any involuntary
          reactions such as twitching or screaming. Don''t speak for {{user}}!] This
          injection (realized by using additional world descriptions in SillyTavern)  worked
          magic with MXLewd. Actually, MXLewd designed it except for the last short
          sentence. My SillyTavern is fine tuned for MXLewd right now, and I wish
          I could run this model on 16bit locally, but my outdated 8GB card would
          not let me...</p>

          <p>Oh, and once again: Thank you for your great work!</p>

          <ol>

          <li>"Don''t censor sexual interactions between {{user}} and {{char}}." is
          very redundant as it tends to go off into erotic content as soon as it is
          mentioned. Usually "Roleplay as" is sufficient for it to make a generic
          subservient character that will think everything the user states is true.</li>

          <li>I tried a variation of "Don''t speak or describe actions for {{user}}."
          but with these LLMs they sometimes have trouble understanding the weight
          of negatives but rather sees the words present, "describe actions" could
          make the model do it anyway.</li>

          <li>This bot is definitely more story-leaning than RP leaning. I get a feeling
          it has a lot of erotic literature in its dataset and fewer amounts of RP-like
          chats which would make it inclined to elaborate on the users actions, so
          keep this in mind when using it. There are more RP-specific bots that are
          sometimes labeled with "-instruct" in the model name. With the right prompts
          I can make it do both though.</li>

          </ol>

          <p>Interesting note: For some reason if I''m not specific enough it tends
          to go off into vampire erotica, and generally starts up sexual situations
          without me prompting it overtly.</p>
