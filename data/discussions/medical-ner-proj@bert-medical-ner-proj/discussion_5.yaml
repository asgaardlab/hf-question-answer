        html: '<p>Hi there. First of all, thank you very much for your model. It is
          great. I was wondering if you could share it with me the following:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>The dataset that you used or at least a sample of it :)</li>

          <li>The metrics and accuracy of your model</li>

          <li>and how you fine-tune your model</li>

          </ol>

          <p>I am using this for a research project, and this information would help
          me a lot. </p>

          <p>Thank you very much</p>
