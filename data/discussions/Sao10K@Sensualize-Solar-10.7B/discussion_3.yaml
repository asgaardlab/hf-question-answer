          <p>If you ever decide to retrain the model, it would be neat if the main

          instead of the base version. It, in my opinion, outshines base Solar in
          every aspect and would also greatly help with your goal of making the ERP
          better while also keeping the model smart. Thanks again for the finetune.</p>
