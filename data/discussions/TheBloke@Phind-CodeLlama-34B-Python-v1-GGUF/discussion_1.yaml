          <p>The following prompt was used to create the code for snake in text generation

          <p>Prompt:<br>I need you to write 1 piece of python code for a functioning
          game of snake. Make sure to fill every line of code completely, do not leave
          any place holders, as logic for the code must be thought of now and implemented
          in this generation. </p>

          <p>Make sure the game have a window to play in, has proper working food
          for the snake to collect, has the ability for the snake to eat the food
          and grow from the eaten food, has the ability for the snake to die from
          running into itself or the border of the window, and has a restart button
          once the game is over to play the game over again. </p>

          <p>Make sure the game has a simple visual graphical interface for the user
          to see when playing, you will have to code this yourself. Absolutely make
          sure everything mentioned in the code is written, do not leave a class that
          is mentioned somewhere but not written out properly elsewhere Please follow
          this format when writing the code:<br>FILENAME</p>
