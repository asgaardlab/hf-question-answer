        html: '<p>Hello, devs!</p>

          <p>Thank you for your wonderful model, but could you please add ckpt file?
          A lot of guys like me (and the one, who created topic month ago) don''t
          know to start your model. We know how to download ckpt file and paste it
          into models folder. So could you please just create ckpt file in this repository?</p>
