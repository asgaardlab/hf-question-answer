          <p>I''ve responded to your email. Additionally, I''d like to highlight the
          manually annotated dataset I utilized for evaluating the model''s performance.
          You can access the dataset here: <a href="https://huggingface.co/datasets/puzzz21/sci-sentiment-annotated-dataset">Link
          to the Dataset</a>. As mentioned in the email, the model achieved an F1
          score of 0.72 and an accuracy score of 0.73 for sentiment classification
          with this dataset. I hope this information was helpful. Please let me know
          if I could assist you further. </p>
