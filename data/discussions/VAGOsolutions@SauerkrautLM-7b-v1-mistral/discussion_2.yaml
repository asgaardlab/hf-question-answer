          <p>It would be interesting to see how your finetune works on the Falcon
          models, it might be the better candidate.</p>

        html: '<p>Hey cmp-nct.<br>we have already fine-tuned the falcon 40b for internal

          <p>The smaller models in particular sometimes produce incorrect German sentences,
