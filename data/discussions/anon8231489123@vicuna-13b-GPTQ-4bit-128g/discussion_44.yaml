        html: '<p>Hello, I am following a tutorial to get vicuna working through a
          UI via oobabooga &amp; in the tutorial it says to add --wbits 4 --groupsize
          128 after "call python webui.py" in my start.bat file. I did that, like
          so:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6452f337c895e6437dc79a20/uKIhyp26U32Gbtr8PZFCs.png"><img

          <p>However, when I try to run the start.bat file I get prompted with this
          error:<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6452f337c895e6437dc79a20/6_qyJRjtLT1M5mO1GdPfu.png"><img

          <p>Any help on this would be greatly appreciated! I was able to launch the
          UI without having --chat --wbits4 --groupsize 128 in the start file, but
          it was riddled with errors, and obviously the chatbot did not generate any
          responses to my input.</p>
