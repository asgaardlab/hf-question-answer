          it became yet another distraction employed by certain politicians and other
          public figures to distract people from things that matter and keep people
          fighting with one another. Usually, I hear it employed by right-leaning
          ideologues.  And that''s hilarious, considering, for instance, whose bill
          this was:</p>

          <p>"Sen. Patrick J. Leahy (D-Vt.), who opposed the bill, said: "I hope that
          nobody thinks that this is a victory for child pornographers. . . . This
          is a victory for the First Amendment."</p>

          <p>But a key sponsor of the original bill, Sen. Dan Coats (R-Ind.), said
          the Supreme Court was "out of touch with the American people on this."</p>

          <p>"I''m very disappointed," he said.</p>

          <p>Donald P. Hodel, head of the Christian Coalition, said the "frustrating"
          decision marks "a sad day for our nation" and "leaves our nation''s children,
          basically, exposed to the worst kinds of pornographic material."</p>

          <p>President Clinton''s Justice Department had argued in favor of the law.
          But yesterday Clinton issued a statement that expressed no regret over the
          decision and called the Internet "an incredibly powerful medium for freedom
          of speech and freedom of expression that should be protected."</p>

          <p>He said children must be protected from the adult material that can be
          found online, and he pledged to convene a meeting of industry leaders, teachers,
          parents and librarians to find "a solution for the Internet . . . that protects
          children in ways that are consistent with America''s free speech values."</p>

          <p>The decision does not affect prohibitions against material found to be
          "obscene," which is illegal in any form.</p>

          <p>Former senator Jim Exon (D-Neb.) first proposed the bill in 1995 to crack
          down on the online equivalent of open-air porn bazaars online: sites from
          which anyone could download sexually explicit images and even video clips.
          The bill''s introduction spurred many of those sites to place their raunchiest
          wares behind electronic doors accessible only with a credit card, and it
          led to a number of software products that allow parents to filter what their
          children might find online, though with varying degrees of effectiveness.
          The Internet decency law ultimately passed as part of a broad revision of
          U.S. telecommunications laws in February 1996."</p>

          <p>But sure, "wokeness" is the problem.  </p>

          <p>Anyway, this is all about avoiding lawsuits.  I strongly suspect that
          otherwise, the researchers behind this wouldn''t have even cared.  People
          are projecting all of this onto them.</p>
