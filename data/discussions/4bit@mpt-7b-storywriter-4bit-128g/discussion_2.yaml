        html: '<p>I managed to get it running, but the output leaves much to be desired.</p>

          <p>My original experiment was to feed it the first chapter of Neuromancer
          (14k tokens), to see if it could write a new 2nd chapter. It started by
          hallucinating about a girl named Candy, citing sources, followed by some
          ramblings about timekeepers, butterflies, and getting completely lost.</p>

          <p>2nd experiment, I fed it the first couple pages, a few dozen paragraphs.
          This immediately hallucinated that the prior text was a journal entry, and
          began an entry about its time in Las Vegas in the 1990''s, then another
          journal entry filled with acknowledgements and copyrights. Amusingly it
          began describing a doctor''s credentials (MD, PhD, MBA), followed by a 30+
          letter acronym of some other credential it made up (CPTDSAFCetc...).</p>

          <p>3rd experiment I fed it the opening line of the book, and it actually
          managed to write a conversation, but it devolved quickly into an encyclopedia
          acid trip. :laughing:</p>

          <p>It likes to smash words together, so added some spaces and apostrophe
          where I could see they should go. Enjoy!</p>
