        html: '<p>In the description you mention that what matters is the relative
          order for the sentence similarity task and not absolute values of the score
          similarity. I have a dataset of mathematical definitions and methodologies
          .What puzzles me is that even when the query has nothing relevant with the
          dataset  I get a high score so I can not trust this model ''s output. Also
          I have to mention that is the only model I have found which does an excellent
          job  for the Greek language. Do you know how I cam bypass the problem of
          questions which are out of context? Setting a threshold doesnt seems to
          work. Really need  your opinion on that</p>

        html: '<p>Apologies for the confusion. As I mentioned earlier my dataset holds
          mathematical definitions and corresponding questions written in the Greek
          language. When the query is relevant to the context of the dataset, meaning
          that there is an answer which corresponds to the question, then I always
          retrieve the correct definition using the embeddings produced by the model.
          So it does an excellent job in my test case.  The only problem I am facing
          is with questions that are out of context and how I can filter them out.
          Fine tuning perhaps? I am sorry if this is not the right place to post that
          kind of question. If that''s the case feel free to delete.</p>
