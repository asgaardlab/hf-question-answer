        html: '<p>Just curious, does the training dataset includes the truthfulqa
          dataset which is being used during evaluation for Open LLM LB? </p>

          <p> If so, is it still fair to use truthfulqa as a metric to evaluate this
          model? Because compared with other 3B, (or maybe 65B/70B) models, the truthfulqa
          metric is very high.</p>

          <p>Interesting part is according to your config.json the base model is RedPajama-INCITE-Chat-3B-v1
          which has all other evals higher then your model beside truthfulqa_mc. So
          yeah I think something is quite not right here. </p>

        html: '<p>Oh, there is the issue.<br>I utilized parts of the ARC and truthfulQA
          dataset.<br>I recently (about 2 weeks ago) discovered that my format for
          answering questions in ARC was incorrect. Previously, I did not provide
          the correct letter choice like this: </p>

          <pre><code>&lt;Question&gt;

          A. &lt;first option&gt;

          B. &lt;second option&gt;

          &lt;Letter of the correct answer&gt;

          </code></pre>

          <p>But instead of the above I used this format:</p>

          <pre><code>&lt;Question&gt;

          A. &lt;first option&gt;

          B. &lt;second option&gt;

          &lt;text of the option instead of one letter&gt;

          <p>That''s why it gets so bad ARC score, will fix this issue as soon as
          possible and update the dataset and the model.<br>Thanks for reporting it!</p>
