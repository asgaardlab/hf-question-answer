        html: '<p>Normally I save a model''s VAE in the models/stable-diffusion folder,
          using the same name as the model, but naming it .vae.pt.  In this case there
          is just the one orangemix.vae.pt, but I have AOM3, A1, A2 and A3.  How do
          I get it to automatically choose the oragemix.vae.pt without making four
