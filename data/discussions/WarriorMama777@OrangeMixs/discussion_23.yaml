          <p>this example here is the only  decent output from my early test today
          before it went even more weird. It''s a bit off especially the background

          Decent compared to the top results. too bad it stopped there :(<br>does
          anyone think it is malfunctioning? I hope it will be back to normal soon
          as this was the first model I was getting better quality results from as
