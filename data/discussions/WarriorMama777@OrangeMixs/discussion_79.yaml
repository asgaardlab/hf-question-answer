        html: '<p>Hello! So, I''ve upgraded from using version 2 to version 3, however,
          I''m running into the issue of purple splotches in the output, I attribute
          this to be because I don''t have the VAE installed on version 3. My google
          collab is unable to load in VAE''s, so is there a guide on how to do this,
          or is it best to wait for the version with the VAE pre-baked in?</p>

          <p>Thanks.</p>
