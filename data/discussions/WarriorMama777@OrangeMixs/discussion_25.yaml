        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>I''ve been fruitlessly trying to clone the model repository via git bash
          for a bit now.<br>If run as instructed it will download all small files
          just fine but throw a ''smudge error'' and ''LFS authorization error'' on
          any larger file.</p>

          <p>If run with ''git lfs install --skip-smudge'' it will populate all the
          correct files and directories but doesn''t actually download the full files.<br>I''m
          somewhat stuck at a dead end here, maybe missing some other prerequisite?
          (I have huggingface-hub and cli)</p>
