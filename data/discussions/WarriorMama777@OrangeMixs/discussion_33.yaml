          The approach LiKaige has outlined does work, but you can also add to the
          **negative** prompt **(swimsuit:1.1), (leotard:1.1)** to reduce the weights
          for those, or anything else that shows up that you do not want that has
          a valid tag. It seems to work well, grid example with many simple tags for
          complete outfits, but should work fine when putting together your own. Generated
