          Models can have different sizes depending on if they are pruned/unpruned
          or fp16 vs fp32.


          Pruning is removal of components and weights in a model that are not useful
          for one reason or another.


          There is not any difference in quality between them, as such pruned fp16
          versions are preferred.


          I will also mention, fp16 vs fp32 can have different results, but they are
          simply different, not higher or lower quality. By default, automatic1111
          loads and processes everything as fp16, so you wouldn''t notice a difference
          between a model that is fp16 vs fp32.


          I have a separate pull request to add pruned, fp16, ckpts and safetensors
          with the orangemix VAE baked in (no need to set or download separately),
          you can find those here.
