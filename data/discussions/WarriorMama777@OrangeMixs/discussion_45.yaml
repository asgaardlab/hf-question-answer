          You have the right model, one is the new hash format, and the other is the
          old.


          New format hash: 0873291ac5

          Old format hash: a87fd7da


          As for getting different results, you need to copy all of the parameters,
          not just the prompt, to get nearly the same result.


          The easiest way is by downloading the PNG images people post (assuming they
          were generating using automatic1111, and the user left it configured to
          add metadata), then dragging the file into the PNG info tab in automatic1111.
          This will extract the generation parameters for you, then you can easily
          send them to txt2img to try to replicate and to experiment.


          Here is an example that has the metadata for you to test with. This was
          generated using nsfw and with the orangemix VAE.
