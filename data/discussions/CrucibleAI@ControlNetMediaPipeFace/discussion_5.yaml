  content: "We've pushed the checkpoints for the SD 1.5 version of Control MediaPipe\
    \ Face!  \n\nWe debated internally about holding off and letting the model train\
    \ further, but decided ultimately that it is sufficiently useful as-is.  We will\
    \ continue to train the model for a while after this release to see if there are\
    \ any gains to be had and, if there are, we'll release a v3.  For now, please\
    \ have fun with this and let us know about the neat things you make."
