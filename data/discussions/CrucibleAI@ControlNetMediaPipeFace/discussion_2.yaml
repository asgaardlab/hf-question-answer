          <p>How well does it detect anime faces?  Or how well does it work at generating
          them?  For detection, it uses MediaPipe''s facemesh, so it''s a little touch-and-go.  Not
          amazing at detecting them.  For generation, it leans on StableDiffusion,
          so it should work fine there.</p>
