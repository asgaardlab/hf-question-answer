        html: '<p>Sure.  The original batch of images was created on our branch of
          the ControlNet repo: <code>https://github.com/crucible-ai/ControlNet/</code>
          with the <code>gradio_face2image.py</code> script.  If MediaPipe is missing
          faces, it''s likely because of cropping or resizing issues.  The face detection
          component is particularly sensitive to "canvas size" settings.  If a face
          is not detected and the aspect ratio is non-square, it can be worth manually
          padding the image out to square.  Are you using the automatic1111 webui?</p>
