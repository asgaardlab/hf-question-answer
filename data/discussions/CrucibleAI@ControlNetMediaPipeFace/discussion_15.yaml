        html: '<p>Hi there.  To answer <a href="/CrucibleAI/ControlNetMediaPipeFace/discussions/1">#1</a>,
          the network is not perfect.  It will still get gaze direction wrong some
          of the time and for some art styles.  It can help to add to the prompt "looking
          to the left" or things like this, but it''s still not quite a guarantee.  To
          answer <a href="/CrucibleAI/ControlNetMediaPipeFace/discussions/2">#2</a>,
          that is a current version, yes.  I think there''s an apple-silicon version,
          too, but that shouldn''t be needed unless you''re on an ARM chipset.</p>
