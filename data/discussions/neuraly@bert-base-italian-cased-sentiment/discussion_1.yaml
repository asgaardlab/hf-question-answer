        html: '<p>I tried using your model for classifying multiple sencences:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>I encoded the sentences</li>

          <li>I did padding / truncating for having encoding of the same dimension
          (512, which is the maximum length for your model)</li>

          <li>Then I classified all the sentences</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Since it was an attempt, I used small phrases such as "Amo tutti, vi
          voglio bene", or "Odio tutti, vi detesto".<br>I received as a result that
          the sentences were neutral (I think it''s because of the padding). When
          I classify them one by one, I then get correct results.<br>Why do padding
          influences the results?? </p>
