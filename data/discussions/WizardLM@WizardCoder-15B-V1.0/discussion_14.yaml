          <p>Been trying for a while to shift from GPT to an open source model. I
          tried many models but all failed except WizardCoder. You can clone the repo
          to try out the WizardCoder Agent yourself. </p>

          <p>I will be deprecating the GPT version soon to completely shift to WizardCoder.
          Many thanks to the WizardCoder team for such wonderful work. Looking forward
          to future releases.</p>
