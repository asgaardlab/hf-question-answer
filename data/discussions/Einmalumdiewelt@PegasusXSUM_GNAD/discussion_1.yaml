        html: '<p>Hi Dennis,</p>

          <p>Thanks! GNAD refers to a custom dataset I web-scraped from a German news
          publisher. I plan on releasing it in the near future if the news publisher
          does not mind. At this point in time, however, I can''t publish it.<br>I
          also plan on fine-tuning one of those models on a huge portion (like 400k+
          articles) of my dataset soon. All those models are only fine-tuned on 30k
          samples for 10 epochs at this point.</p>

          <p>Best regards,<br>Einmalumdiewelt</p>

          fine-tuned on top of the (English) base models, correct? Would be interested
          to see how it performs with a "monolingual German" model, such as <a href="https://huggingface.co/GermanT5/t5-efficient-gc4-german-base-nl36">this
