        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I saw that you had some old models, as I am a collector I have to ask
          you if you could open them for download again for me only the ckpt/safetensor
          files would suffice.</p>

          <p>I remember seeing the following models</p>

          <ul>

          <li>yxma</li>

          <li>anjyuneko</li>

          <li>kurxmi</li>

          <li>mnatsbki</li>

          <li>hxzuki </li>

          <li>rxri</li>

          <li>beendark</li>

          <li>jk</li>

          </ul>

          <p>If you have made some custom mixes with the well known models in the
          following repositories I would be grateful to have a look at them</p>

          <ul>

          <li>chilloutmix</li>
