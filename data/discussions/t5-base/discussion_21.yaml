        html: '<p>Hi Guys,<br>Hope everyone are doing good.<br>Actually i am using
          this T5Base model for Translation. I am training it to translate USA english
          to German, Italian and French. You know the units and measurements in USA
          will be in inches and foots but in europian regions it will be centimeters
          and meters. i need to know few details related to T5,<br>1.)Will this model
          capable of units conversions?<br>2.)Minimum most how many data set in a
          csv file i need to give for training to get a standard result?<br>3.)I need
          to achieve brand specific tone setting during translation, can i achieve
          using T5?<br>4.)In USA english scripts there will be special characters
          like copyright, trademark symbols but for other reagion it is not necessary
          to be present, can i achieve this charactrestic in T5?<br>5.)Can this T5
          convert the currency according to the region as units which is mentioned
          in 1.)</p>

          <p>Please can any one help me with the above queries? if this is not possible
          with T5 please suggest an AI model (opensource and free) which will be helpfull
          for me.<br>Thanks in Advance.</p>
