          <p>While i too wouldnt really no where to start, or how best to go about
          it,  (not even sure its done this way currently - i often get wrongly detected
          male.f/emale, detections, not every guys a square jaw chad, or every gal
          have a petite / femine appearance, feel like its even the opposite for both
          when facial hair is not a factor.</p>

          <p>But essentially male and females have distinct and measurable differences
          in key points of the facae and distances between .  and are fairly reliable,
          though more so on adults, or teens, less so on children, accuracy wise,
          but some points u can still rely on like distance from upper lip to nose
          (female is notably shorter distance). cheek bone protrusion, lower jaw width
          that sort of thing.  Check table 1 here, and the euclidean distances between
          these facial areas / points/sections.  th  Its good, but limited data set.  search

          to Gender-Affirming Facial Surgery" doi.org/10.1089/fpsam.2021.0301</p>

          <p>Can get this very same info, which using a much larger dataset on wikipedia,
          but pay attention to the probabilities for both men and women, and would
          have to factor that in, and have a small set of samples for both men and
          women, with varying degree of accuracy, similar to how they break it down
          here, obviously the more control samples u have across that range, then
          more chance of success.   Also need to have the option, where body exists
          in pic, or not just head then can have a backup, or confirmation step (no
          pun intended) to detect hip width / breast / // bulges / shoulder width,
          etc, adams apple,  probably dont even n eed to go to that much detail, but
          no doubt u get the idea</p>

          <p>Im keen to work on this, can put together a more concise, iterated/ step
