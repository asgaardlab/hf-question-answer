        html: '<p>Dear TinyLlama team - congratulations on an excellent project -
          we just fine-tuned the 2.5T checkpoint for an ongoing series of RAG-optimized
          fact-based question-answering models - very good results, especially for
          a 1.1B parameter model - you can see the results measured on a RAG benchmark
          test too - <a href="https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-tiny-llama-v0">bling-tiny-llama-v0</a>
          - you may be interested to compare with the pythia-1b base which we finetuned
          as <a href="https://huggingface.co/llmware/bling-1b-0.1">bling-1b-0.1</a>  ....
          I will look forward to the 3T checkpoint - and will pursue additional experiments
          and projects with TinyLlama ... All the best, Darren</p>
