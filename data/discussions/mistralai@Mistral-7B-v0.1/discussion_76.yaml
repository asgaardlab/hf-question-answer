        html: '<p>Have you guys heard of MemGPT? I was curious if you had, and if  you
          have, what your thoughts were on it and  how best we could make Mistral-7b-v0.1
          support function calling? It would be amazing to have the power of Mistral-7b-v.0.1
          combined with the seemingly infinite coherent context that MemGPT provides,
          given of course that Mistral-7b-v0.1 supports function calling. Let me know
          your thoughts guys and devs. The future is looking very bright! Thank you
          for your time and consideration. </p>
