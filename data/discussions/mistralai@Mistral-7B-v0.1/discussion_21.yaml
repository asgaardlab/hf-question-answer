          <p>I understand the idealogy, ''make it bigger to make more power''. That''s
          the same approach Google and openAI took and now it requires supercomputers

          with 1.7T on alpacaeval and Zepher 7b matching the 1.7T model on some benchmarks
          should inspire people to focus more on refinement than just resize. The
          biggest advantage of 7b models is efficiency especially if you need to run
          multiple models for different agents at the same time on consumer-grade
          devices. Let''s not forget the main goal of open-source AI, making it accessible

    \ power'. That's the same approach Google and openAI took and now it requires\
    \ supercomputers to run those models. Seeing models with only 70b (XWIN-LM) surpassing\
    \ gpt4 with 1.7T on alpacaeval and Zepher 7b matching the 1.7T model on some benchmarks\
    \ should inspire people to focus more on refinement than just resize. The biggest\
    \ advantage of 7b models is efficiency especially if you need to run multiple\
    \ models for different agents at the same time on consumer-grade devices. Let's\
    \ not forget the main goal of open-source AI, making it accessible for everyone."

          <p>You are right about not needing a supercomputer for 13b but my point
          is not to shift from the current strategy, it winning against models 100x
          bigger. For the need of more raw power, you have Mixtral 8x7b. That has
          42b parameters making it 3x bigger than the 13b you''re asking for.</p>
