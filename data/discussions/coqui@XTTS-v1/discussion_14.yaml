        html: '<p>Ahh so it isn''t just me. I have experienced this as well. Because
          my first step was to read the documentation in full, I am aware that the
          recommendation for the reference is:</p>

          <p>-6 seconds or more of audio reference<br>-No background noise/mic bumps
          etc<br>-Cleaner audio file<br>-No big silences on reference audio (at start
          and end especially)</p>

          <p>As an audio engineer, I have ensured that this is the case. That''s all
          I can say to make you believe me. Yet, I consistently struggle with both
          Turkish and Portuguese (the two that I''ve been trying to use). I have a
          couple other things that I want to try to tackle it but I can definitely
          say that I am experience a language bias.</p>

          <p>I really hope that someone that cares about the other languages, perhaps
          from Coqui, would give something more than a copy-paste of documentation
          that I can look up myself. Gorkem seems to be the one on the socials that
          is the closest to who we need. </p>

          <p>But, erenfazlioglu, it is very likely that we''ll have to solve this
          ourselves. I have an idea; I''m just working on another project right now.
          When I test it, I''ll get back to you. If you have to know-how to test it
          without being guided, it''s basically a small-scale implementation of <a
