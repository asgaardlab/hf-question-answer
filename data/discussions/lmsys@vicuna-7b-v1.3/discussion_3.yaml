        html: '<p>Thank you for the great work!</p>

          <p>I just ran into the issue "OSError: lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3 does not appear
          to have a file named config.json" when I am trying to load the pre-trained
          model using <code>AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("lmsys/vicuna-7b-v1.3")</code></p>

          <p>The transformers version I am using is 4.33.3. I was able to load it
          appropriately yesterday. But somehow it suddenly failed today. </p>

          <p>Could you help me with this? Thank you!</p>
