        html: '<p>Hello Bohan Du,</p>

          <p>I wanted to express my appreciation for your work on fine-tuning the
          OpenLlama and stableLM models. I''ve converted all of them (that are convertible)
          to the llama.cpp native .gguf file format, with most conversions completed
          even before the Bloke did them. Notably, I''ve included the OmegLlama and
          Bean models, which are currently missing on theBloke''s side.</p>

          <p>I recently noticed that you''ve linked back to "theBloke''s" converted
          versions of your models on Hugging Face - but at least the <code>OmegLlama</code>
          and <code>Bean</code> models are still missing, so maybe you like to include
          backlinks to <code>.gguf</code> versions of them too, so mine are here:
          <a href="https://huggingface.co/maddes8cht/acrastt-OmegLLaMA-3B-gguf">OmegLlama-3b-gguf</a>
          and <a href="https://huggingface.co/maddes8cht/acrastt-Bean-3B-gguf">Bean-3b</a>.<br>There
          are also my collections of <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/maddes8cht/stablelm-gguf-65552101dcf410fd072c6c87">StableLM</a>
          and of <a href="https://huggingface.co/collections/maddes8cht/open-llama-gguf-6554be6495885c0796c026a6">OpenLlama</a>
          models, all converted to gguf, and including your models.</p>

          <p>Note that my focus is on models with genuinely free licenses (no "pseudo-OpenSource"
          as in Metas License ), and I''m committed to fostering a culture of open
          source in the AI community. I understand that theBloke has also done commendable
          work, and I''m not here to compete but to contribute collectively to the
          availability of models under real open-source licenses.</p>

          <p>If you have any feedback, suggestions, or if there''s a specific model
          you''d like to see converted into gguf format, please feel free to let me
          know.</p>
