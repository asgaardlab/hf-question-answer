        html: '<p>Hi there! Thanks for all the hard work! I absolutely love the style
          of image this diffusion spits out! </p>

          <p>I did run into a snag with it though, I set up my local setup, and got
          this up and running, enter my prompts, and run it... While it''s generating
          the image, and i''m able to preview it, the pictures look to have good color.
          However, when the image is done rendering- the colors are all super faded.</p>

          <p>Not sure if there''s a separate file I''m supposed to have to help with
          this, but figured it couldn''t hurt to ask.</p>

          <p>Thanks once again!</p>
