        html: "<p>I have cleaned up the output a bit on this, but you get the general\
          \ idea from a set of reasoning questions:</p>\n<p>A woman named Barbara\
          \ has 8 brothers who love her very much.  Those brothers have 2 sisters.\
          \  How many sisters does Barbara have?<br>  8 brothers have 2 sisters, and\
          \ Barbara is one of those sisters. So Barbara has no other sisters besides\
          \ herself.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>So, she has one sister?<br> The question\
          \ states that Barbara's brothers have 2 sisters. Since Barbara is one of\
          \ those sisters, she does not have any other sisters besides herself.  Answer:\
          \ 0</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Shea pondered for a moment, weighing\
          \ the pros and cons. The moral depravity of it did not bother him in the\
          \ least, it was the economical despatching of his plan which bothered him\
          \ the most. The faithful execution of it depended on two things. One was\
          \ to gain her trust implicitly and he smirked when he thought of how easily\
          \ he had managed that.  What are Shea's true feelings in this example?<br>\
          \  He is confident in his plan and is excited to execute it.### Explanation:\
          \  The passage describes Shea as smirking, which indicates a sense of satisfaction\
          \ or amusement. This suggests that he is confident in his plan and excited\
          \ to execute it.### Answer:  He is confident in his plan and is excited\
          \ to execute it.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Does he seem morally\
          \ depraved?<br>  Yes, he does.### Explanation:  The passage describes Shea\
          \ as pondering the moral deprivation of his plan, which indicates that he\
          \ is aware of its immoral nature. However, this does not bother him in the\
          \ least, suggesting that he is indeed morally depraved.### Answer:  Yes,\
          \ he does.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The second was to convince\
          \ her boyfriend that he was harmless enough to be with her during the intervals.\
          \ If the second did not work, the entire plan would have fallen to bits.\
          \ Shea twisted his mouth in a snarl which rarely accompanied his surreal\
          \ moments with the unsuspecting Adeline.  What do you think about this second\
          \ piece of information about Shea?<br>  He is confident in his ability to\
          \ manipulate people.### Explanation:  The passage describes Shea as twisting\
          \ his mouth in a snarl, which indicates a sense of determination or focus.\
          \ This suggests that he is confident in his ability to manipulate people\
          \ and ensure the success of his plan.### Answer:  He is confident in his\
          \ ability to manipulate people.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The\
          \ death of Theodisus 11 in 450 AD led to serious repercussions for Attila.\
          \ Theodisus\u2019s successor, Marcian, refused to continue paying the tribute,\
          \ which in turn aroused Attila\u2019s fury. As always, his prudence always\
          \ foreshadowed him even in his fury and he decided to vent his anger on\
          \ the West instead of the East, as it was weaker.  Eventually Attila\u2019\
          s troops razed through some of the best cities of civilised Europe. They\
          \ were erased to the ground in Attila\u2019s usual custom and Attila would\
          \ have done so even with Rome itself if not for the intervention of the\
          \ Pope himself who, it was said, went personally to meet Attila in his tent\
          \ and so prevented major devastation.  What effect did Attila's actions\
          \ have on Europe?<br>  Attila's actions led to the destruction of some of\
          \ the best cities in Europe.### Explanation:  The passage states that \"\
          Attila\u2019s troops razed through some of the best cities of civilised\
          \ Europe\" and that \"Attila would have done so even with Rome itself if\
          \ not for the intervening of the Pope.\" This indicates that Attila's actions\
          \ had a significant destructive impact on Europe.### Answer:  Attila's actions\
          \ led to the destruction of some of the best cities in Europe.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\
          <blockquote>\n<p>Looking at his credit card bills, Mr Johnson sighed. He\
          \ decided to place a cap on the household spending.  Explain the use of\
          \ the word \"cap\" in this context.<br>  In this context, \"cap\" refers\
          \ to a limit or restriction on spending.### Explanation:  The passage describes\
          \ Mr Johnson as placing a cap on the household spending, which means he\
          \ is setting a limit or restriction on how much money can be spent. This\
          \ suggests that he is trying to control and reduce his spending.### Answer:\
          \  In this context, \"cap\" refers to a limit or restriction on spending.</p>\n\
          </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p> The impact of her parents\u2019 death hit\
          \ her hard. Holding back her tears, she cast him a sorrowful look.  What\
          \ is the word \"cast\" mean in this context?<br>  In this context, \"cast\"\
          \ means to direct one's gaze or look at someone or something.### Explanation:\
          \  The passage describes her as \"cast[ing] him a sorrowful look,\" which\
          \ means she directed her gaze or looked at him with a sad expression. This\
          \ suggests that she is emotionally affected by her parents' death and is\
          \ trying to express her feelings through her eyes.### Answer:  In this context,\
          \ \"cast\" means to direct one's gaze or look at someone or something.</p>\n\

          \ More people suffer from it than known statistics indicate as it is rarely\
          \ detected from the outside. Even a sufferer of depression may not be aware\
          \ of having it until he/she is diagnosed by a medical practitioner. According\
          \ to statistics, it is not only adults who suffer from it but children as\
          \ well.  Why does the author say that depression is a \"curse of the modern\
          \ world\"?<br>  The author believes that depression is a widespread and\
          \ significant problem in today's society.### Explanation:  The passage describes\
          \ depression as a \"curse\" because it is a widespread and significant problem\
          \ that affects many people, including both adults and children. The author\
          \ suggests that it is not always detected from the outside, and even those\
          \ who suffer from it may not be aware of their condition until they are\
          \ diagnosed by a medical practitioner. This implies that depression is a\

          </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>He raised his voice slightly and did not\

          </blockquote>\n<blockquote>\n<p>You are given the following premises: Someone\
          \ who lives in Dreadbury Mansion killed Aunt Agatha. The only people who\
          \ live in Dreadbury Mansion are Aunt Agatha, the butler, and Charles. A\
          \ killer always hates his victims, and is never richer than his victims.\
          \ Charles hates no one that Aunt Agatha hates. Aunt Agatha hates everyone\
          \ except the butler. The butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha.\

          \ follows<br>from the premise.<br>  The butler killed Aunt Agatha.### Explanation:\
          \  Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the reasoning:  1. Aunt Agatha hates\
          \ everyone except the butler, and the butler hates everyone not richer than\
          \ Aunt Agatha. Since Aunt Agatha is not the butler, this means that the\

          \ Aunt Agatha, this means that the butler cannot be the killer.  3. This\
          \ leaves Charles as the only remaining suspect. Charles hates no one that\
          \ Aunt Agatha hates, which means that he does not hate the butler. Since\
          \ Aunt Agatha hates everyone except the butler, and Charles hates no one\
          \ that Aunt Agatha hates, this means that Charles must hate the butler.\
          \  4. The killer always hates his victims and is never richer than his victims.\
          \ Since Charles hates the butler and is not richer than Aunt Agatha (who\
          \ is richer than the butler), this means that Charles cannot be the killer.\
          \  5. This leaves only one possibility: the butler killed Aunt Agatha. The\
          \ butler hates everyone not richer than Aunt Agatha, and since Aunt Agatha\
          \ is richer than the butler, this means that the butler must hate Aunt Agatha.\
          \ Since the butler is the only person who lives in Drearbury Mansion and\

          \ Europe\" and that \"Attila would have done so even with Rome itself if\

          \ In this context, \"cast\" means to direct one's gaze or look at someone\
          \ or something.### Explanation:  The passage describes her as \"cast[ing]\

  content: Thanks for the reports. As there was no tokenizer.model I used a new llama.cpp
    PR to make the GGUF, which uses only tokenizer.json.  Apparently this hasn't worked
    correctly.  I'm now re-creating the GGUFs using the updated files in the base

          The Llama Legacy


          Once upon a time, in the lush green Andean mountains, there was a quaint
          little village named Pampas. The villagers of Pampas were well-known for
          their extraordinary llama herds, which they raised and cared for with great
          love and dedication. They believed that these gentle creatures possessed
          magical qualities that brought good fortune to the village.


          In the heart of Pampas lived an old woman named Abuela Rosa, who was revered
          as a wise healer and a keeper of ancient knowledge. She had a special bond
          with a herd of llamas that she tended to every day, bestowing upon them
          her love and care. Among all the llamas in the village, Abuela Rosa''s herd
          was the most cherished and respected.


          One fateful day, while Abuela Rosa was busy preparing a remedy for a sick
          villager, she noticed an odd-looking llama wandering into her enclosure.
          The creature had a unique coat of multi-colored fur, unlike anything she''d
          ever seen before. Intrigued by the strange llama, she decided to adopt it
          and named him Llama Luna, after the mesmerizing lunar eclipse that graced
          the sky that very night.


          Llama Luna quickly became a sensation in Pampas. The villagers marveled
          at his vibrant fur and unique beauty. But more than just an oddity, they
          soon discovered that Llama Luna possessed extraordinary abilities. When
          the villagers were in distress or faced with difficult decisions, they would
          consult with Abuela Rosa, and she, in turn, sought the wisdom of Llama Luna.
          The gentle creature would then offer guidance through a subtle tilt of his
          head, a soft hum, or even a gentle nudge with his nose.


          Over time, Llama Luna''s fame spread beyond Pampas. People from distant
          villages traveled great distances to seek the counsel of Abuela Rosa and
          her magical llama. The village prospered, and so too did the bond between
          Abuela Rosa and Llama Luna. As the years passed, their connection grew even
          stronger, and it seemed as if they shared a single soul.


          One day, an elderly man named Don Pedro arrived at Pampas from a distant
          land. He carried with him a heavy heart, as he had lost his only daughter
          to a terrible illness many years ago. Having heard tales of Llama Luna''s
          wisdom, Don Pedro sought solace and guidance in the company of Abuela Rosa
          and her magical companion.


          As he shared his story with them, Llama Luna gazed deeply into Don Pedro''s
          eyes, sensing the depth of his grief. Suddenly, he let out a piercing cry
          that echoed throughout the village. Abuela Rosa interpreted Llama Luna''s
          message and explained to Don Pedro that his daughter had not truly left
          this world, but rather was reborn as a beautiful bird that would visit him
          each night.


          Don Pedro, overcome with joy, wept tears of gratitude. From that day forward,
          he would eagerly await the arrival of his daughter''s spirit each evening.
          And so, Llama Luna not only offered wisdom and guidance to the villagers
          but also brought comfort and solace to those in need of healing.


          As time continued to pass, Abuela Rosa grew frail with age. One morning,
          as she awoke to find Llama Luna lying beside her lifeless, tears filled
          her eyes. Overcome with sorrow, she realized that her faithful companion
          was no longer there to bring her comfort. Yet, as the sun began to rise
          and bathe the world in its golden light, a magnificent bird perched on her
          window sill. The beautiful creature gazed at Abuela Rosa with love and understanding.


          And thus, the legend of Llama Luna lives on, reminding all who hear it that
          even in the face of loss, there is always hope and comfort to be found,
          for life is an ever-revolving cycle of beginnings and endings.
