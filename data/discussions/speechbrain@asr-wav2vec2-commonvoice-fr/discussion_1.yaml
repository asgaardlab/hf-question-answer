        html: '<p>Greetings,</p>

          <p>Concerning the checkpoints available through the google drive (README
          file of the asr-wav2vec2-ctc-fr recipe), is there any change that should
          be done on the scripts? I''ve found two issues when running the pre-trained
          model:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Locally: large WER (73.46) when running the train script on inference
          mode (asr_brain.fit section commented in the main)</li>

          <li>Remotely: recurrent error of "forward() expects 2 arguments but 3 were
          given](TypeError: forward() takes 2 positional arguments but 3 were given".
          This error was never seen when running the script locally. I believe it
          may be due to the singularity used. Is there any speechbrain/pytorch singularity
          readily available?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Thank you very much in advance</p>
