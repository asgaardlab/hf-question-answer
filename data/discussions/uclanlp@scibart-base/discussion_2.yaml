          <p>Thanks for reporting this issue. However,  we are unable to reproduce
          this error. We tried creating a new conda testing environment and installing
          transformers cloned from <code>git clone https://github.com/xiaowu0162/transformers.git
          -b scibart-integration</code>. Then both the AutoTokenizer and SciBartTokenizer
          work normally with SciBART. If you use an environment, can you check if
          the environment is activated?</p>

          <p>Best,<br>Di</p>

          <p>Thank you, I indeed use an environment and yes I verified if the environment

          installed. I used the same command line as you to clone the needed version
          of transformers.<br>I tried with 3 environments: 1 older, the one I am currently
          working on and a brand new environment.<br>I had the bug with the last two.
          However, with the first one, it went smoothly so it seems that the problem
          is on my side.</p>

          <p>To look at the difference between the two environments, I did a pip list.<br>The
          one that works has this for transformers <code>transformers             4.30.0.dev0
          /home/&lt;my_username&gt;/transformers/src </code><br>For the two other
          environments that bring the error, I have this <code>transformers             4.30.0.dev0

          <p>I think it may have something to do with the versions of pip there is
