        html: '<p>Hello, I am very happy with this LLM, i have use it a little bit
          and its way better than PandasAI, which was a disappointment.<br>I notice
          that this was a retrained model to specifics and i was surprise how good
          it was with matplotlib, but the score was pretty low so it will probably
          fail on more complex attempts.<br>I wonder, how much computing power do
          you need to push more training and make it better in Matplotlib? i want
          to see if i can help a bit to improve this one it seems you have a good
          thing here. </p>
