        html: '<p>Hi</p>

          <p>Thanks for the interesting new model! I''m going to quantize it and help
          more people find out about it.</p>

          <p>You''re missing all the tokenizer files from your repo - tokenizer.json,
          tokenizer.model, tokenizer_config.json.</p>

          <p>For my quantisations I have grabbed the files from huggyllama/llama-13b.  I
          could PR them here, but I thought it''d be better if you added them, just
          in case you''ve customised them in any way?</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>

          <p>PS. Any plans to train this on Llama 2?</p>
