          <p>It seems like an error with your CUDA installation. you can check it
          here:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://xcat-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/gpu/nvidia/verify_cuda_install.html">https://xcat-docs.readthedocs.io/en/stable/advanced/gpu/nvidia/verify_cuda_install.html</a></p>

          <p>Then, you can do a run a simple test in python to assess that torch has
          access to the GPU (this should print a 10x10 tensor filled with ones that
          are allocated in the cuda device):<br>python -c "import torch; print(torch.ones((10,10)).to(''cuda''))"</p>

          <p>Hope it helps.</p>
