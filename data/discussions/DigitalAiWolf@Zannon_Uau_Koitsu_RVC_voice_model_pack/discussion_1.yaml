        html: '<p>This RVC model pack contains 4 vocal types. Basic ( best for talking
          and singing), the (singing) voice well as the name implies best for singing
          and has better vibrato over the base voice. The (rock vocals) was trained
          using grit vocals but done in a yell voice to capture the growl or rock
          vocals intended for rock music or just act as a good distorted voice. The
          (Falsetto) is as the name implies a voice for high notes.</p>

          <p> The base voice can do #A2-A2 being a Bariton Tenor voice with a very
          good voice range.  (My native voice range is #F2-A2 so the ai voice model
          lacks the super bassy ranges). This RVC voice pack is intended to offer
          quality and flexibility.  Any further voices or requested voices will need
          to be discussed with me on discord (my discord name is zannonkoitsu#0849
          )</p>

          <p> Otherwise, if anyone needs the raw audio files. You can download them
          here:  <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.mediafire.com/file/w251owcqpcd2ojh/vocal_refferences.zip/file">https://www.mediafire.com/file/w251owcqpcd2ojh/vocal_refferences.zip/file</a></p>
