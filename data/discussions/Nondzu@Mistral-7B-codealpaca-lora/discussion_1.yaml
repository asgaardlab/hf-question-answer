        html: '<p>Hello,<br>thank you for sharing. I want to make myself a finetuned
          mistral model with custom dataset. Please tell me how did you trained yours
          if you like. How do you make a finetune lora model joined with the original
          mistral model into a single finetuned model. I saw other guys that make
          a distinct finetune model than the original one ..then load both. I''m interested
          to know how to make 1 single model joined from original mistral + finetuned
          model , like yours. Thnak you for help!</p>
