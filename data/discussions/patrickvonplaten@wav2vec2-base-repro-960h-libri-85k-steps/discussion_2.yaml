          I tried to fine-tune this checkpoint with librispeech train-clean-100h datasets
          by loading it with Wav2Vec2ForCTC.from_pretrained() function.

          However, WER is not as low as I expected. (about 46%, fine-tuned with same
          datasets with ''facebook/wav2vec2-base'' : 6%)

          Have you fine-tuned the wav2vec2 model with this checkpoint? If so, did
          you use a different configuration file?


          Thank you.'
