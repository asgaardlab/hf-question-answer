        html: '<p>Or how about a safetensor at least? Many users have no clue how
          to implement with pipeline . . .</p>

          <p>Update: I tried the safetensor under "text_encoder" in NMKD''s GUI and
          it had no effect at weight of 1.0. I also tried safetensor conversion and
          told me there already was one. It may not work as a separate file :/ </p>

          <p>Great idea for a LORA tho. I will try to use it with Automatic111 or
          ComfyUI soon. </p>
