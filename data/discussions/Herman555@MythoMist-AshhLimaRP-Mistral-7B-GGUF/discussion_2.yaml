        html: '<p>My personal favourite currently is MythoMist, I think it''s probably
          the best general RP/ERP 7b model we have from my limited testing so far.
          </p>

          <p>Most prompt formats were tested and LimaRP Extended Alpaca preset is
          probably the best. However the prompt is more of a template and should be
          customized for higher quality outputs. It should also be noted that I prefer
          to roleplay with no asteriskses, using only quotation marks for speech which
          likely influences the quality of the output. Lastly the Ashhwriter dataset
          isn''t perfect, the author has mentioned there might be typos and whatnot.</p>

          <p>I think ultimately it depends on the kind of character cards you use.
          Besides the intelligence of the model the writing style is a big factor
          also and therefore the best thing you can do is try the models yourself.
          Brief impressions are as follow for the AshhLimaRP versions.</p>

          <p><strong>Dolphin 2.2.1</strong> - Does romantic/softcore ERP well. Minimal
          impersonation. Good, believable emotions, quite smart in general. Suited
          to submissive character cards.</p>

          <p><strong>OpenHermes 2.5</strong> -  Exceptional hardcore ERP. Impersonation
          occured consistently at certain moments, extra instructions didn''t help.
          Stupid GPT4 (I''m guessing) "And this will leave a mark on her heart forever"
          sort of crap. Basically unnecessary narration at the end is common. Weird
          prompt gibberish. Suited to dom characters.</p>

          <p><strong>Synatra 0.3 RP</strong> - I liked the writing style of this model
          a lot, it is not the sharpest model in the shed but I think it did both
          dom and sub characters decently. Minimal impersonation. Well suited for
          general ERP. In other words it''s a jack of all trades.</p>

          <p><strong>MythoMist</strong> - I have been waiting for a 7b mythomax for
          a long time now, this is probably the closest thing to it. Smart model,
          beautiful writing. Going from Q4_K_M to Q5_K_M improved the quality of roleplay
          and simpleproxyfortavern presets significantly in SillyTavern, less impersonation.
          Same unnecessary narration problem.</p>

          <p>All credits go to <a href="https://huggingface.co/lemonilia">https://huggingface.co/lemonilia</a></p>

          <p>Everything they come out with is fantastic and improves RP/ERP output
