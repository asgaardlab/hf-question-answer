          8k allows it also, but the Airoboros 33b GPTQ SH8k feels like a 13b model
          due to the increase in perplexity. This one finally feels like a 33b.<br>It
          also works very well with SillyTavern and the Arena presets in terms of

          version !<br>Many thanks and much gratitude !</p>
