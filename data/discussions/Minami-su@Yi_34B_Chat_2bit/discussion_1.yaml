        html: '<p>Hi, I saw that you quantized Yi 34B with QuIP#, exciting to see
          our stuff being used. I was playing around with this model on interactive_gen.py
          and it doesn''t seem to be very good at handling chinese tokens. Did you
          generate hessians with the default redpajama dataset we hardcoded in hessian_offline_llama.py?
          If so, you''ll want to generate hessians with a chinese + english dataset
          to get accurate hessians for quantization.</p>
