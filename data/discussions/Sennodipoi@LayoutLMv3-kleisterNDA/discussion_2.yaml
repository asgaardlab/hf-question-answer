        html: '<p>Hi Malte, glad to know that people are interested in this :)</p>

          <p>You''re definitely right, I should put more info in the model cards.
          I''m planning to update them all after my thesis defense. </p>

          <p>In the meanwhile, if you are interested in LayoutLMv3 for Kleister-NDA,
          I was able to reach a f1 score of 0,94 using the same segmentation strategy
          used by the original authors for FUNSD i.e. using labels to create segments.
          However, in the case of Kleister-NDA I believe that this strategy significantly
          helps the model and thus it severely impacts the evaluation of the model.</p>
