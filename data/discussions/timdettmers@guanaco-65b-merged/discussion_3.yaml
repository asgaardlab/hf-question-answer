          research, you can lookup in other <a href="https://huggingface.co/timdettmers">timdettmers</a>
          models. Usually no one starts from 65B model, and it''s pretty tedious to
          explain the same thing in dozens of similar model cards. Most people here
          are already familiar with how to use it, if you are not - check the qlora
          github repository mantioned above, there is a lot of good explanations there.
