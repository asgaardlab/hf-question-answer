        html: '<p>I''m curious how/why the base length is 8,000 . Was max_seq_len
          just set like this as config (since the model uses ALiBi).</p>

          <p>I assume I could set max_seq_len to a higher value, or is that configuration
          hard coded for a given quantized model?</p>

          <p>Lastly, is the main benefit of quantization that you get some reduction
          in the model size and run time (say a reduction to 5/16ths of size if using
          int5 versus fp16 (or is it bf16)?</p>
