        html: '<p>Oh, HPSv2 is trained exclusively on English captions. But we do
          have the corresponding Chinese prompts. Do you think it''s very helpful
          if a model trained on Chinese prompts are available? I feel that most state-of-the-art
          models in the open-source community, like SD, only supports English prompts.
          (am I correct?) Then, how do you think of its usage if there is a Chinese
          version? </p>
