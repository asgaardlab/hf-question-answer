        html: '<p>Hi guys! First, congratulations on the model and model card, super
          clear and insightful. I''m currently trying a personal project where i can
          give the model the schema of several tables (column names and descriptions)
          and can "fine tune" the model on my datasets, so it can answer questions
          more focused on this fictional business. Do you guys have any idea on how
          to do this? Kinda new to NLP and LLM''s</p>
