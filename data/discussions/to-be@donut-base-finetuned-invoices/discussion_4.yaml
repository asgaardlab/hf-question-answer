          <p>I have been using this implementation of DONUT for a use case regarding
          invoices. First of all, thank you for this codebase - It is really helpful.</p>

          <p>However, I was wondering if there a provision to change the text generator
          model being used by this pipeline. Is there a particular reason that options
          like GPT2 were not used to generate the text from image?</p>
