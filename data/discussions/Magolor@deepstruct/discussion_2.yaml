        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>As mentioned in title, I''m curious what is difference between 10B and
          10B_1.<br>In github code, it downloads both 10B and 10B_1. According to
          scripts in <code>src/tasks/mt</code>, Some tasks(ADE, SNIPS, ...) use 10B
          model and some(ACE2005,  CoNLL05, ...) use 10B_1.<br>I couldn''t find any
          mention about this. Can you please explain the difference?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
