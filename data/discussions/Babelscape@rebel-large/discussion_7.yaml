          <p>Up to this point the boys have maintained a fragile balance, with Jack\u2019\

          \ this balance is destroyed, and Jack controls both the means of sustaining\
          \ the fire and keeping the boys obedient to his rule, Ralph is rendered\
          \ powerless. Unlike Ralph, who expects the boys to be intrinsically motivated\
          \ to work together, Jack is willing to exert external influence on boys\
          \ who disobey him, and leads by force, rather than persuasion. Motivated\
          \ by a fear of Jack\u2019s violence as well as a mob mentality, the boys\
          \ pursue Ralph across the island, even though he poses no actual threat.\
          \ Even the twins Samneric, initially sympathetic to Ralph, give themselves\
          \ over to Jack after he tortures them to reveal Ralph\u2019s hiding place.\
          \ The boys set a fire to flush Ralph out of the jungle, which signals a\
          \ passing ship. The ship\u2019s officer comes on shore, reintroducing civilization,\
          \ and the boys realize</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>If I feed that into the model,\
