        html: '<p>Hi. First, thanks for this model. Think its a great tool. Just want
          to share a query I have using the example of text below:</p>

          <p>text = "The introduction of co-feedstocks increased the CH4 production"</p>

          <p>My current results are along the lines of:<br>[{''head'': ''co-feedstock'',
          ''type'': ''product or material produced'', ''tail'': ''CH4''}]</p>

          <p>I would like to use the transformer to produce something like:<br>[{''head'':
          ''co-feedstock'', ''type'': ''increased'', ''tail'': ''CH4 (production)''}]</p>

          <p>Does this fall under relation classification rather than relation extraction?</p>

          <p>If so, how might I go about doing this using your model? I read in your
          paper that RC is possible.</p>

          <p>Thanks again!</p>

        html: '<p>Hi there, sorry for the late reply.</p>

          <p>RC means that you provide the model with the head and tail entities.
          While rebel was not pretrained for RC, you can finetune on top of it with
          your  own data (ie. a relation like increased). In the paper we did by adding
          special tokens before and after the head and tail entities within the text.
          </p>

          <p>Our newly released multilingual model <a href="https://huggingface.co/Babelscape/mrebel-large">mrebel</a>
          is pretrained also for RC, you can give it a try. Just add # before and
          after the head and @ for the tail:<br>"The introduction of # co-feedstocks
          # increased the @ CH4 production @"</p>

          <p>And set the token  as the first token to generate after the language
          code instead of . Be aware that this will return just one relation and that
          it will be from the ones seen during pretraining.</p>

          <p>Best,<br>Pere-Lluis.</p>
