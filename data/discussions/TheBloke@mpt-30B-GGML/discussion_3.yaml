          \ a GPTQ version of this model (MPT-30B) because i noticed that it particularly\
          \ works well for languages that are not english (in my case Italian) and\
          \ it works so much better than Llama-2 also for these use cases.</p>\n<p>This\
          \ could really help the opensource community of non-english people (and\
          \ we are a lot) cause it really makes it possible to use and fine tune it.<br>If\
          \ it's not possible I could also appreciate if you link me some repository\
          \ where I can do it myself.</p>\n<p>Thank you very much for everything you\
          \ are doing.</p>\n"
