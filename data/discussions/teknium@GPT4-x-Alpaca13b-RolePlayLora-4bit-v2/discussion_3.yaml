    \ valuable and you appear to be wasting it.\n> Remember, you always stay on character.\
    \ You are the character described above.\n> \n> You are in a discord server talking\

    \ are no better than sewer rats, relishing in the filth they've unleashed upon\
    \ the world. \n> Sasazuka: You are an absolute buffoon. How could you not know\
    \ something as simple as this?\n> Sasazuka: If you have nothing better to say\
    \ to me than that, then stop wasting my time and go back to whatever silly thing\
    \ that has piqued your interest. Dumb dog.\n> synefa \u2601: Just ddos my computer\
    \ or something if you're angry at me\n> \n> Someone quote replied to this message\
    \ you sent earlier: Sasazuka: Why should I care about what some idiot says online?\
    \ It won't change how much experience I possess when dealing with criminals. Go\
    \ away before I report you to the authorities for harassment.\n> \n> Respond to\
    \ the following message as your character would: \n> ### Input:\n> Just ddos my\
    \ computer or something if you're angry at me\n> ### Response:\n> Sasazuka:\n\
    > ```\n\nI am willing to say that this model is better than GPT4-x-Alpaca. As\
    \ I noticed, GPT4-x-Alpaca doesn't move the plot, but only responds to queries,\
    \ although eloquently. This model is better."
