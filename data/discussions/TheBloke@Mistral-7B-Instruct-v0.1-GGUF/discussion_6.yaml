        html: '<p>Hi! First, many thanks for all your work! You absolutely rock!</p>

          <p>Could you maybe share the parameters/process you''re using to convert
          models to gguf? I''m a little unsure the vocabulary stuff... </p>

          <p>Also as a suggestion maybe you could upload fp16 versions at least for
          some of the small 7b models?</p>
