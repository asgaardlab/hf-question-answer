        html: '<p>Hi NickyNicky,<br>Thanks for sharing this !<br>I have a question:<br>if
          you fine-tune the<br>togethercomputer-LLaMA-2-7B-32K base model on a dataset
          with short contexts (length of input short), would you then expect it to
          perform well when given longer inputs ? </p>

          <p>(I am assuming you trained it with a dataset in which the length of input
          was less than 3000 tokens. )</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance for your reply. </p>

          <p>P.S: also, would it be possible to share the script you use ( I guess
          QLoRa)<br>I tried it one one RTX 4090 (24GB) but get out of memory errors
          even using batch_size 1 .<br>I then shortened to 6k. It is still training
          but I can see already a very strange loss curve :-(  </p>

          <p>Update:<br>it did not work.<br>When I tried it on inputs which are longer
          than the maximum tokens I trained it on, it gives non sensical replies.<br>I
          guess one would  need a bigger GPU to exhaust the full length (or at least
          get something like 16k).<br>How many RAM did you used ? </p>

          <p>I saw in the threads below that the gentleman needed 2 A600s (2 x 48GB)  for
