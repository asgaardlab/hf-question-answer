          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6448e05081c086e0a420a033/40rp4sNKvlwyq_0F8vLWS.png"><img

          <p>This happens also with LLaMA2 itself, but the interesting thing is that
          using HF spaces it does not happen (instead it seems very good in keeping
          the context).</p>

          <p>Thanks for the help.</p>
