        html: '<p>I''ve not managed to load the model in Oobabooga''s Text Generation
          web UI.</p>

          <p>For one thing, I don''t know which loader to use. I''ve tried them all,
          but they''ve each found an error (not always a new error), and none managed
          to load the model, leading me to believe I may need to fidget with the loader
          settings as well. Found errors include " ''hidden_size''", "At least one
          of the model submodule will be offloaded to disk, please pass along an <code>offload_folder</code>"
          and "Trying to set a tensor of shape torch.Size([32, 512]) in "qzeros" (which
          has shape torch.Size([1, 512])), this look incorrect."</p>

          <p>Any help would be much appreciated!</p>
