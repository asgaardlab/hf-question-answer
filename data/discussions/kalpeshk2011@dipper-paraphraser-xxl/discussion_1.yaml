        html: '<p>Hey, I''m wondering whether any post-hoc detector could be trained
          to detect texts generated/paraphrased by DIPPER. I see that DIPPER has parameters
          for adjusting the lexical diversity and the amount of content re-ordering
          in the paraphrase, which I assume mitigates the effectiveness of such a
          detector. </p>

          <p>Is there any published research on this? I''d be interested in seeing
          the detection performance of e.g. Ghostbuster by Verma et al. (<a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/vivek3141/ghostbuster">https://github.com/vivek3141/ghostbuster</a>)
          trained on text generated by DIPPER.</p>
