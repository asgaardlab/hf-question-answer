          <p>I''ve been trying to run some of these, and they just seem ... bad lol.  I
          mean, like they''ve been huffing model airplane glue or something.  I can''t
          imagine that they actually are that bad, or else people wouldn''t be bothering
          with them.  I''ve tried the various min-p settings in sillytavern and a
          bunch of other ones, and the text just doesn''t seem particularly ... coherent.  Are
          they particularly sensitive to settings, or ... I mean, it''s like working
          with a mule.  I have to ban the EOS token sometimes just to make the thing
          keep going, and, of course, that ultimately doesn''t fix it.  Best case,
          the prose they generate seems to lack detail, and they don''t like doing
          anything for more than a few paragraphs.  I try to adjust the settings,
          but anything that makes them keep going just makes them way dumber haha.</p>

          I find that sometimes you have to swipe to get a ''just right'' response.
          Usually the swipe is for that, not because anything is gibberish or unusable.

          <p>Again, very much not an expert, but I''ve at least been having fun with
