        html: '<p>Hi! I was wondering how did you obtain <code>tokenizer.model</code>
          file? In other available korean base llama models like <code>beomi/llama-2-ko-7b</code>,
          they used FastTokenizer provided by HF tokenizers not the sentencepiece
          package, so the output doesn''t contain <code>tokenizer.model</code>. Can
          you share how you obtained <code>tokenizer.model</code> file from <code>tokenizer.json</code>?<br>Thank
          you for your help!</p>
