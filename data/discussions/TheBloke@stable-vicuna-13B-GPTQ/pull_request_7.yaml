        html: '<p>Yeah this looks odd, but I am not sure it''s wrong. I had exactly
          the same confusion when I first saw it, and I tried changing it as you''ve
          done here but it made no difference to output.  The model will only respond
          with the very specific prompt template, and it responds fine when using
          that template.  In my testing, changing special_tokens_map.json didn''t
          enable it to respond to other prompt templates.</p>

          <p>They very definitely have this setup in the original release, so I''m
          going to keep it the same unless there''s proof of a specific improvement
          that can be achieved by changing it.</p>

          <p>Thanks anyway!</p>
