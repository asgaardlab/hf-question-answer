        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Thank your for your work, I am using it through webui and it''s just
          great. I would like to use the model to summurize my emails but loading
          it and using the generate function is not working I guess since it''s a
          quantized model. Is there a documentations or a way to load the model easily?</p>

          <p>I tried to break down the way the model is loaded in webui and used the
          load_quant() function to load the model but I get an this error:</p>

          <p>Error(s) in loading state_dict for LlamaForCausalLM:<br>    Missing key(s)
          in state_dict: "model.layers.0.self_attn.k_proj.bias", "model.layers.0.self_attn.o_proj.bias",
          "model.layers.0.self_attn.q_proj.bias", "model.layers.0.self_attn.v_proj.bias"
          etc................</p>

          <p>I think that there''s an exemple or a collab that shows how to load quantized
          models and accelerate the loading. I have a 4090, and the loading and vram
          used when loading through webui is just amazing.</p>

          <p>Many thanks</p>

          \ hunter-gatherers living in caves and small villages. They had not yet\
          \ learned how to farm or raise livestock for food, but they did know how\
          \ to hunt and kill other animals for meat. And so it was that the llama\
          \ became one of the favorite prey of these early humans, who would follow\
          \ herds of wild animals into the hills and mountains to hunt them down.\n\
          Over time, the human population spread out across the continent, and with\
          \ them came new opportunities to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals.\
          \ And so it was that the llama became a popular source of protein among\
          \ these humans, who would follow herds of wild animals into the hills and\

          \ and expand, the opportunity to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals\
          \ also grew. And so it was that the llama became an increasingly popular\
          \ source of protein among these humans, who would follow herds of wild animals\
          \ into the hills and mountains to hunt them down.\nThroughout history, the\
          \ human population has continued to grow and expand, bringing with them\
          \ new opportunities to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals. And so it\

          \ a time, there was a llama. This particular animal lived in what is now\
          \ known as South America. It was here that the llama first appeared on this\
          \ earth and became one of the most famous animals in history.\nThe story\
          \ of the llama began over two thousand years ago when humans were still\
          \ hunter-gatherers living in caves and small villages. They had not yet\
          \ learned how to farm or raise livestock for food, but they did know how\
          \ to hunt and kill other animals for meat. And so it was that the llama\
          \ became one of the favorite prey of these early humans, who would follow\
          \ herds of wild animals into the hills and mountains to hunt them down.\n\
          Over time, the human population spread out across the continent, and with\
          \ them came new opportunities to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals.\
          \ And so it was that the llama became a popular source of protein among\
          \ these humans, who would follow herds of wild animals into the hills and\
          \ mountains to hunt them down.\nAs the human population continued to grow\
          \ and expand, the opportunity to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals\
          \ also grew. And so it was that the llama became an increasingly popular\
          \ source of protein among these humans, who would follow herds of wild animals\
          \ into the hills and mountains to hunt them down.\nThroughout history, the\
          \ human population has continued to grow and expand, bringing with them\
          \ new opportunities to hunt and eat the flesh of other animals. And so it\
          \ was that the llama became an ever more popular source of protein among\
          \ these humans, who would follow herds of wild animals into the hills and\
          \ mountains to hunt them down.\nToday, the story of the llama continues,\
          \ as this remarkable animal remains one of the favorite sources of protein\
          \ among humans, who will follow herds of wild animals into the hills and\
          \ mountains to hunt them down.\nroot@ad62753e041d:/workspace#\n```\n\nSo\
          \ two outputs were good, one was bad.  I'm still figuring out why I sometimes\
          \ get these bad results. But that may be due to the model itself rather\
          \ than GPTQ specifically.  It may need tweaked parameters or a slightly\

  content: "There's a new system for making and using GPTQs called [AutoGPTQ](https://github.com/PanQiWei/AutoGPTQ).\
    \ It is much easier to use.\n\nIt supports Triton or CUDA, but Triton only works\
    \ on Linux or WSL2, not Windows.  By the way, you may want to consider trying\
    \ WSL2. It's easy to install, works with NVidia GPUs and CUDA, and will likely\
    \ make coding for AI much easier.  It would enable you to use Triton with GPTQ,\
    \ and generally makes it easier to follow all the new repos that are appearing\
    \ for AI stuff.  \n\nIf you want to try it, google \"WSL 2 install\" and follow\
    \ that, and then read this guide on how to set up WSL2 with CUDA: https://docs.nvidia.com/cuda/wsl-user-guide/index.html\n\
    \nAnyway, for your issue I recommend you check out AutoGPTQ instead of GPTQ-for-LLaMa.\
    \  It does still have some issues and complications, but in general it's much\
    \ easier to use. And it's being actively improved every day. It's the future of\
    \ GPTQ.\n\nGo to the AutoGPTQ repo and follow the instructions for installation.\
    \  This should hopefully be as simple as `pip install auto-gptq`.\n\nThen here\
    \ is some sample code that works with my stable-vicuna-13B model:\n\n```python\n\
    from transformers import AutoTokenizer, pipeline, logging\nfrom auto_gptq import\
    \ AutoGPTQForCausalLM, BaseQuantizeConfig\n\nquantized_model_dir = \"/workspace/stable-vicuna-13B-GPTQ\"\
    \n\ntokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained(quantized_model_dir, use_fast=False)\n\
    \ndef get_config(has_desc_act):\n    return BaseQuantizeConfig(\n        bits=4,\
    \  # quantize model to 4-bit\n        group_size=128,  # it is recommended to\
    \ set the value to 128\n        desc_act=has_desc_act\n    )\n\ndef get_model(model_base,\
    \ triton, model_has_desc_act):\n    if model_has_desc_act:\n        model_suffix=\"\
    latest.act-order\"\n    else:\n        model_suffix=\"compat.no-act-order\"\n\
    \    return AutoGPTQForCausalLM.from_quantized(quantized_model_dir, use_safetensors=True,\
    \ model_basename=f\"{model_base}.{model_suffix}\", device=\"cuda:0\", use_triton=triton,\
    \ quantize_config=get_config(model_has_desc_act))\n\n# Prevent printing spurious\
    \ transformers error\nlogging.set_verbosity(logging.CRITICAL)\n\nprompt='''###\
    \ Human: Write a story about llamas\n### Assistant:'''\n\nmodel = get_model(\"\
    stable-vicuna-13B-GPTQ-4bit\", triton=False, model_has_desc_act=False)\n\npipe\
    \ = pipeline(\n    \"text-generation\",\n    model=model,\n    tokenizer=tokenizer,\n\
    \    max_length=512,\n    temperature=0.7,\n    top_p=0.95,\n    repetition_penalty=1.15\n\
    )\n\nprint(\"### Inference:\")\nprint(pipe(prompt)[0]['generated_text'])\n```\n\
    \nThe code above will use CUDA to do inference from a GPTQ.  It can also suppose\
    \ Triton, by setting triton=True in the `model = get_model()` line. So if you\
    \ do install WSL2, you could try it with Triton also.\n\nThe `model_has_desc_act=`\
    \ argument to `get_model()`specifies whether the model to load uses `--act-order`,\
    \ also known as `desc_act`.  For stable-vicuna I released two model files.  `compat.no-act-order.safetensors`\
    \ does not use act-order/desc_act, and `latest.act-order.safetensors` does use\
    \ act-order/desc_act.\n\nThe code as written above will load the `compat.no-act-order.safetensors`\
    \ file. You can load the `latest.act-order.safetensors` file instead by passing\
    \ `model_has_desc_act=True` to `get_model()`.\n\nThis code mostly works. I am\
    \ still getting some poor outputs with it, but this may be due to parameters.\
    \  Here's some example outputs:\n```\nroot@ad62753e041d:/workspace# python stable_gptq_example.py\n\

    so I don't feel like aborting the end use case under way for more tinkering. I'll
    get back to experimentation when new models get released and will focus on deployment
    now.
