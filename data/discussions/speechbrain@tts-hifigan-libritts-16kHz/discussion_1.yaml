        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for sharing this vocoder.</p>

          <p>I am using this vocoder to reconstruct the melspectrogram. I have a wav
          of sample rate 16k, and the length of wav is 65280. I first extract the
          melspectrogram of hopsize=256 and windowsize=1024, and I get a melspec of
          dimension [80,245]. I turn it back to wav by using this vocoder, but the
          reconstructed wav has length 62720 (does not match the input)! The difference
          is always 2560</p>

          <p>I checked the config of vocoder, including hopsize and window size, and
          they are the same as the mel extraction process. Although there is no significant
          difference when human listening, the objective evaluation, like stoi and
          snr and sdr are very very bad (stoi is only 0.15 and sisnr, sdr are negative!
          ). I think it is because the misalignment between input and the output,
          but how to fix this problem?  </p>
