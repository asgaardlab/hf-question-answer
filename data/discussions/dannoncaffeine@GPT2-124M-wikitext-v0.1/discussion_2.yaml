        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I realized that Colab was a waste of time, after 5 hours of training
          it somehow shuts down my process and leaves me with the "To continue using
          Colab connect to the runtime again". I moved the notebook over to <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://www.runpod.io/">RunPod.io</a>. I''ve heard good feedback on
          them. It''s under training on 1 x RTX 4090. I''ll update the readme accordingly.</p>
