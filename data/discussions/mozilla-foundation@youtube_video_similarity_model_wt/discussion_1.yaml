        html: '<p>Hey,</p>

          <p>Will you be updating this model with the second version which does not
          use the cross encode model? Also have you shared the dataset, I can''t find
          the data so I can train my own model.</p>

          <p>One issue I see is that we get a different result with:<br>v1 , v2<br>vs<br>v2,
          v1 I think we should either train on both on cross encoder or use the v2
          model which would give the same result. Can you share the v2 model please.
          </p>
