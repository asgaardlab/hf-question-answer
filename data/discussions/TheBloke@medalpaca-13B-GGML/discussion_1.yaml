        html: '<p>I have been posting my observations with this model at ImpactFrames''
          Medalpaca Youtube video. My initial impressions of Medalpaca''s diagnostic
          abilities are mixed. It offers some good suggestions, however it gets distracted
          by hot-button phrases such as ''homosexual'' which leads it down incorrect
          pathways while entirely ignoring other major data such as tumors. This model
          does not substitute for sound clinical judgment, at least not yet. It is
          amusing to play with.</p>

          <p>Thank you, HF!</p>
