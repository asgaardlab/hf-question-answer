        html: '<p>Hi! I have a hobby project (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://cometocoruna.com">https://cometocoruna.com</a>)
          where I scrape a lot of events, and I need to clasify what type of events
          they are.</p>

          <p>I find this model good enough for my purposes, but I have a problem:</p>

          <ol>

          <li><p>I''m going lean as I currently have no job currently, so I don''t
          want to spend money on running this.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>My server is an atom CPU + 4 GB Ram and no AVX sitting in my bedroom.</p>

          </li>

          <li><p>I don''t think I will be able to use the free-tier API as I will
          make lots of inferences.</p>

          </li>

          </ol>

          <p>Do you think such model is viable to run in my hardware? The compute
          time in HF is fast but they run it in Xeons. </p>
