          <p>I haven''t tried any of your other models yet - I was waiting for maddes8cht/ehartford-WizardLM-Uncensored-Falcon-40b,
          which it looks like is now online, so I''ll download it and try it out as
          soon as I can.  :)  </p>

          <p>Thanks for your work, BTW, on actual open-source-licensed models. I wish
          more people would pay attention to licensing!  LLaMA 2''s viral license
          is a lot more insidious than I think a lot of people realize, harnessing
          the open-source community to do development for them and only allowing LLaMA
          2 derivatives''s generations to be used for training other LLaMA 2-derived
          models, while retaining the full commercial rights if any project ever goes
          big.  FYI, if you''re looking for more open-source models, I noticed that
