        html: '<p>Firstly, thanks for sharing this model!</p>

          <p>I''m trying to use it to read US license plates, but I''m not getting
          very good accuracy, and so I wonder if I''m missing a key step here. I prepared
          a notebook that shows exactly how I''m running inference on the model here:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bB1-raq1ZDsO_qqhhoa6AX4I9lvXpDrK#scrollTo=60CB2TIpqKyH">https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1bB1-raq1ZDsO_qqhhoa6AX4I9lvXpDrK#scrollTo=60CB2TIpqKyH</a></p>

          <p>This is just one example, but I''ve run it on other photos that are quite
          clear and I haven''t got a 100% correct one yet.</p>

          <p>Am I missing any steps? Is this the wrong model to use for US plates?
          Should I be doing any kind of preprocessing on the image first?</p>
