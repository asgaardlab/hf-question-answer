          <p>I put together a notebook that goes through inference for my TrOCR models
          that can be found here: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/DunnBC22/Vision_Audio_and_Multimodal_Projects/blob/main/Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20(OCR)/OCR%20License%20Plates/Inference_of_TrOCR_of_Synthetic_Dataset_Project.ipynb">https://github.com/DunnBC22/Vision_Audio_and_Multimodal_Projects/blob/main/Optical%20Character%20Recognition%20(OCR)/OCR%20License%20Plates/Inference_of_TrOCR_of_Synthetic_Dataset_Project.ipynb</a>.</p>

          <p>The only change that is needed is to change the mode name from this:<br>MODEL_NAME
          = "DunnBC22/trocr-base-printed-synthetic_dataset_ocr"</p>

          <p>to this:<br>MODEL_NAME = "DunnBC22/trocr-base-printed_license_plates_ocr"</p>

          <p>P.S. - In the future, please avoid making unfounded comments (especially
          about people''s ethics).  While I am sure that you were frustrated that
          this project was not working as you wanted, the claim that this is an ethical
