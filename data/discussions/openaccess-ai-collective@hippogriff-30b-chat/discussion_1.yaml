          The open-source community has probably also realized that in order to achieve
          better and more open-ended role-playing effects, it''s not necessarily required
          to align with datasets like Alpaca and Vicuna that resemble GPT more. Instead,
          we should lean towards Pygmalion.</p>

          <p>If you consider releasing datasets like Pygmalion and hellaswag (updated
          with 30K+ rows), it should encourage the open-source community to use Falcon,
          Guanaco, RedPajama, BLOOM, and other tools to train better models based
          on Pygmalion.</p>

          <p>From what I''ve heard from one of the people involved with the project,
          the reason they don''t release it is because it contains a lot of data that
          might be upsetting to some people. If you actually intend to use it for
          training and have trained models in the past you can probably reach out
