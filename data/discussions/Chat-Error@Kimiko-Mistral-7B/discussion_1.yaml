        html: '<p>I''ve been building a chatbot which I''ve standardized on an extended
          version of what I understand to be the Kimiko chat format. My chat format
          builds upon your <code>&lt;&lt;AIBOT&gt;&gt;</code> syntax and adds a perspective
          tag. So I can do things like:</p>

          <p><code>&lt;&lt;slimeq/CHAT&gt;&gt;</code> (a publicly visible text message)<br><code>&lt;&lt;slimeq/SPEAKING&gt;&gt;</code>
          (an internal, narrative message spoken by a character in my story)<br><code>&lt;&lt;slimeq/THOUGHT&gt;&gt;</code>
          (an internal, narrative message thought by a character in my story, which
          nobody else will see)</p>

          <p>To accomplish this I''ve been building a dataset and training a lora.
          My first attempt was a fine tune of the original nous-hermes kimiko, and
          then I moved on to MythoMax and then Tiefighter, both of which immediately
          understood the Kimiko chat format and were able to adapt effectively.</p>

          <p>Now though I''m attempting to move to a mistral base and I''ve found
          that this chat format doesn''t really work at all. I''m wondering what your
          plans are @nRuaif , are you abandoning this chat format or planning to train
          it into a mistral model? It seems like a chatML conversion would be relatively
          easy, just curious if you''ve run into this problem yet</p>
