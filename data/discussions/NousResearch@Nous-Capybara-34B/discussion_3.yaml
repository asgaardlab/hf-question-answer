          \ Windows systems. It provides detailed information about computer performance\
          \ and assists in overseeing running applications and background processes.\
          \ To access Task Manager, follow these steps:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Press the \"\
          Ctrl + Shift + Esc\" keys simultaneously on your keyboard to open Task Manager\
          \ directly. Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button (or press\
          \ \"Windows key + X\") and select \"Task Manager\" from the context menu.</li>\n\
          <li>Once Task Manager opens, you will see several tabs at the top providing\

          \ You can end any process by selecting it and clicking the \"End Task\"\
          \ button below.</li>\n<li>The Performance tab offers an overview of the\
          \ system's overall performance and individual resource utilization trends.\
          \ This includes charts for CPU, RAM, disk, and GPU activity, as well as\
          \ networking data. Clicking on each chart will provide more details and\
          \ options for managing specific resources.</li>\n<li>Other tabs like App\
          \ History show how much data has been used by installed apps, while Network\

          \ user-related activities and low-level process details respectively.</li>\n\
          <li>Finally, the Services tab allows you to manage started services, including\

    \ known as Windows Task Manager, is a system monitor application included with\
    \ Microsoft Windows systems. It provides detailed information about computer performance\
    \ and assists in overseeing running applications and background processes. To\
    \ access Task Manager, follow these steps:\r\n\r\n1. Press the \"Ctrl + Shift\
    \ + Esc\" keys simultaneously on your keyboard to open Task Manager directly.\
    \ Alternatively, you can right-click on the Start button (or press \"Windows key\
    \ + X\") and select \"Task Manager\" from the context menu.\r\n2. Once Task Manager\
    \ opens, you will see several tabs at the top providing different views of the\
    \ system's status. These include Processes, Performance, App history, Network,\
    \ Users, Details, and Services.\r\n3. In the Processes tab, you can view all running\
    \ apps and background processes, along with their CPU usage, memory usage, disk\
    \ usage, network usage, and GPU usage. You can end any process by selecting it\
    \ and clicking the \"End Task\" button below.\r\n4. The Performance tab offers\
    \ an overview of the system's overall performance and individual resource utilization\
    \ trends. This includes charts for CPU, RAM, disk, and GPU activity, as well as\
    \ networking data. Clicking on each chart will provide more details and options\
    \ for managing specific resources.\r\n5. Other tabs like App History show how\
    \ much data has been used by installed apps, while Network shows current internet\
    \ connection statistics. Users and Details tabs display user-related activities\
    \ and low-level process details respectively.\r\n6. Finally, the Services tab\
    \ allows you to manage started services, including stopping, starting, pausing,\
    \ or restarting them. Be cautious when modifying services, as some are critical\
    \ to the functioning of your system.\r\n\r\nTo learn more about Task Manager and\
    \ its features, refer to the official documentation provided by Microsoft or other\
    \ relevant online sources.\r\nUSER: ok cool thanks dog now what is msi after burner\
    \ and why does nobody on the entire planet not even one soul use evga precisionx\r\
