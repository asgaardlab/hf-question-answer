        html: '<p>Thanks again for your great contribution to AI art community. Question,
          how many training images did you use for this model? Did you train the character
          and background styles separately or together in one shot. I was experimenting
          with training on Ghibli style but not getting good results. I was mixing
          characters, backgrounds from different movies for a total of 40 images (20
          characters, 20 backgrounds). I trained for 4000 steps / LR:0.000001 and
          used class prompt (and 1500 reg images) as "artstyle" Any insights are appreciated.
