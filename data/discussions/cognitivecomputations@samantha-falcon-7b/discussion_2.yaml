        html: '<p>I saw the conversation that said you trained this model with Axolotl,

          google colab because I do not have enough memory on my personal computer
          to do it locally. Do you think that could be the problem? I followed the
          instructions on the Axolotl repo (I think) but I cannot tell what I am doing
          wrong. So, I have a few questions for you:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Did you train the model on your computer or in the cloud/on google colab</li>

          <li>What commands did you use to get it to work?</li>

          <li>Could you provide any insight into using Axolotl?</li>
