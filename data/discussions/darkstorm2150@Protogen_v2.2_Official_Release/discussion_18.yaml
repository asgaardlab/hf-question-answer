        html: '<p>Hi!, Thanks for releasing this awsome model!</p>

          <p>I''m trying to finetuning models like yours.</p>

          <p>but I have some questions.</p>

          <p>in README.md at General info tab, it says that "Protogen was warm-started
          with Stable Diffusion v1-5 and fine-tuned on a large amount of data from
          large datasets new and trending on civitai.com.".</p>

          <p>but at the end of the file there is a tab about "Checkpoint Merging Data
          Reference", which looks like what checkpoint''s are used to merge this model.</p>

          <p>does this model trained? or merged?</p>

          <p>thanks.</p>

          <p>ps. is there any Granular Adaptive Learning implementation? I can''t
          find any....</p>
