          <p>They also had an almost completely identical model card to this one until
          i asked about the model card and benchmark scores. After asking they changed
          the model card and told me that they trained on instruct-v1, after that
          i told them once again that its a bit too suspicious that the scores are
          the same, down to the decimals and they completely removed their model discussion
          page.</p>

          <p>I really hope I''m mistaken about this but they''re too suspicious.</p>

          <p>PS: i love your guys''s models, keep up the good work</p>
