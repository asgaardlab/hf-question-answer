        html: '<p>This is some sample data to share with the package. There are 3
          sets of data in this .zip file:</p>

          <p>Set 1 and Set 2 have reconstructions from artificially generated spike
          trains. Both of these are from different runs of the simulation, and have
          switches in state.<br>Set 3 is the ground truth calcium imaging data from
          Purkinje neurons obtained using GCaMP5G and widefield imaging. dF/F values
          were calculated and the traces have already been interpolated to a sampling
          rate of 30Hz and a Gaussian filtered to denoise them.</p>

          <p>All datafiles are .mat files and have the following variables:<br>''ss'',
          ''cf'', ''time'', ''calcium'', ''state'' and ''cell_id'' (the last one is
          only in Set 3). As the variable names suggest, ''ss'' and ''cf'' have time
          stamps of simple spikes and CF inputs; ''time'' has the timestamps, ''calcium''
          has the dF/F signal, from either the experiment or the generative model;
          ''state'' has the same dimensions as ''time'' and stores the state of the
          cell at each timepoint - 0 is ''Bursting'' and 1 is ''Tonic''.</p>
