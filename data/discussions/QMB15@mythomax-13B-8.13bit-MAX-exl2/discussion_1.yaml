          <p>The script spits out a base perplexity when it starts quantizing and
          another when it''s done, that''s what I was comparing. Make sure to check
          those, as the newest version of exllamav2 has a few bugs that can cause
          it to run into precision issues and spit out a very large ppl, that''s a
          sign that your quant is messed up. It''ll still work, but suboptimally.<br>measurement.json
