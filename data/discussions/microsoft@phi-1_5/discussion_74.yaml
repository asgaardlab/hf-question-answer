        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>the technical report states that phi-1.5 was trained on a dataset of
          30 billion tokens (Section 1), however Table 1 and Section 2.3 indicate
          that it was trained for 150 billion tokens. Does it mean that the model
          went over the synthetic 30B token dataset 5 times, i.e. that the pre-training
          lasted 5 epochs?</p>

          <p>Best,<br>Ansar</p>
