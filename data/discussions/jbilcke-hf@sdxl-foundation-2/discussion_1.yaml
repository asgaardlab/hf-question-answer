        html: '<p>I was looking at this and some of your other uploads, well the ones
          that are xl archives. I don''t see a safetensor file in the root directory,
          that matches the name of the archive, like  sdxl-foundation-2.safetensors
          or something.  I see a bunch of your training folder data, like 2000 and
          3000. Is the lora the 23 mb pytorch in the 3000 folder? Should I just take
          that safetensor and rename it? I was wondering if you could explain how/which
          file  to get from these archives. Thanks</p>
