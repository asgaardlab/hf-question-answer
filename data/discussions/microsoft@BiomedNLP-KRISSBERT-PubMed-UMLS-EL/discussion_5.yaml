        html: '<p>First of all, thank you for making KRISSBERT available as open source.
          A very good approach to biomedical entity linking.<br>I have a more general
          question about the performance of the model. As stated in the readme, the
          top-1 accuracy for the full MM dataset is 58.3%. In comparison, the paper
          states that the accuracy should be 70.7% for the lazy supervised apporach
          (<a rel="nofollow" href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07887.pdf">https://arxiv.org/pdf/2112.07887.pdf</a>
          Table 2).<br>Can you please tell us why there is this (large) discrepancy
          between these two performances? Are there any important "components" missing
          from this model compared to the model you used to analyze the statistics
          in the publication?</p>
