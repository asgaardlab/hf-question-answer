          <p>I wonder the input format of <code>ELYZA-japanese-Llama-2-7b</code>.</p>

          <p>As from the blog post, this model is further trained starting from <code>meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-chat-hf</code>,
          but the training dataset is consisted of OSCAR or Wikipedia.</p>

          <p>How did you make normal text from OSCAR or Wikipedia into instruction
          format, which is required by <code>Llama-2-7b-chat-hf</code>?</p>

          <p>Thank you in advance.</p>
