        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Im not sure if this is the right forum for this question, but what are
          the diffusion_pytorch_model.bin<br> files for.  I have downloaded the model
          from stabillityai''s github repo, and downloaded the 768-v-ema.ckpt file
          which i can use for inference.  but what are the diffusion_pytorch_model.bin
          model files that i can see in the files and versions tab on hugging face.  Are
          the needed for inference or training?</p>
