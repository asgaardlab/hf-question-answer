        html: '<p>Before the new year 2024, I used the same code in the image to generate
          images based on a prompt provided (I am doing this for my master''s research)
          and the model could be downloaded within a few minutes (max 5 minutes).
          After the new year, I run the same code but it keeps trying to download
          the model and it never finishes. I kept it for an hour but it never finished.
          </p>

          <p>Any one has faced the same problem and managed to solve it?</p>
