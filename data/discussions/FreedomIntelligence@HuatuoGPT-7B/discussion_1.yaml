        html: '<p>When deploying a large model with weights that exceed the file size
          limits of the system or are simply too large to be managed efficiently as
          a single file, it is common practice to split the model''s weights into
          multiple segments. These segments are often named in a sequence, such as
          <code>pytorch_model_0001-0003.bin</code>, indicating different parts of
          the model''s weights.</p>

          <p>In such cases, you would typically find a file named <code>pytorch_model.bin.index.json</code>
          in the model''s directory. This JSON file acts as a manifest, mapping which
          weights are contained in each binary segment file. This allows the loading
          process to understand how to reconstruct the full model''s weights from
          the segmented files.</p>

          <p>When you are setting up the <code>model_path</code> in your environment,
          you should point it to the directory containing these files rather than
          any individual segment file. The model loading utility will reference the
          <code>.index.json</code> file to correctly assemble the weights and load
          the model.</p>

          <p>Here is an example of how you might set the <code>model_path</code>:</p>

          <pre><code class="language-python">model_directory = <span class="hljs-string">"/path/to/your/model/directory"</span>  <span
          class="hljs-comment"># This should be the directory containing the segmented
          weight files and the index.json.</span>

          model = YourModelClass.from_pretrained(model_directory)

          </code></pre>

          <p>Make sure that the <code>YourModelClass.from_pretrained</code> method
          or its equivalent in your framework is designed to handle the indexed loading
          process. If you''re using a custom loading mechanism, you would need to
          implement the logic to parse the <code>.index.json</code> file and load
          the weights accordingly.</p>
