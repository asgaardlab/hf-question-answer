          <p>How do I set that up? I don''t use the "Default tab" I don''t know how
          to use that? For example I don''t think it can continue a conversation or
          instruction right? Basically I instead choose "Chat" and than I click the
          Instruct button. And then I can type my prompt and hit generate. </p>

          confused the difference between a Chat Template and I guess system prompt?
          How do properly set this up and use it in Chat Instruct mode? If I can''t
          and I have to go to the default tab? How can I have a long conversation
          and keep asking questions? Thanks. </p>

    \nMakes sense and yes for all I knew maybe you used Ooba if you don't I completely\
    \ understand. I you do include a full setup guide for local use of your model\
    \ including how to use the right system message etc. That would be cool but likely\
    \ goes far beyond what is expected. So don't feel like you have to do that. At\
    \ least not for me. If it comes out I will make use of it though. So thanks for\
    \ even suggesting you might do that. \n\n> Try to copy \"system\" example in to\
    \ character's context\n> \n> ![Screenshot from 2023-12-16 18-29-22m.jpg](https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/63037b895c70c21d0ea80b0e/fzDUrB_yR6BQlfYpQc-XL.jpeg)\n\
    \nIt's done under character? That seems wrong to me. Maybe your right though but\
    \ I thought that Chat-Instruct did not use any char data or info. But I won't\
    \ lie Ooba is not that straight forward. "
