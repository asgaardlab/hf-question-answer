        html: '<p>Thanks a lot first of all as I am a completely beginner for AI and
          maybe this request is stupid or naive. After looking some tutorial on youtube
          about how to deploy open source models on runpod I decided to try, as it
          looks like not so difficult to do it, so I setup a profile and created a
          POD 1 x RTX A6000<br>16 vCPU 62 GB RAM, 1000 GB of volume. Anytime I try
          to download the model (but is the same with ALL the models ,so for sure
          the mistake is mine somewhere) , it takes a lot to complete the download
          and when I try to Load the model (with Transformers) the situation never
          change from "Loading ehartford_dolphin-2.5-mixtral-8x7b..." , and after
          10 minutes nothing change so I have to stop (and money spent for nothing)
          without being able to try the model. Do you have an idea about where I do
          something wrong? As this is the same also with other models (like mistral-7b
          for example). Maybe the configuration is wrong? I tried to empower more
          the setting but nothing is changing. I''m really depressed. </p>
