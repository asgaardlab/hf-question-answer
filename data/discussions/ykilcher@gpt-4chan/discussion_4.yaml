        html: '<p>Hi HF team</p>

          <p>I see the model is currently not available at all to download and I wanted
          to ask what I can do so you''d be fine with having it available.</p>

          <p>Just to state the obvious, I''m totally ok with not having the model
          on here, this is your website and if you don''t want it, that''s cool with
          me. Also, if you want to put any sort of condition, warnings, registrations,
          all totally ok with me.</p>

          <p>What I''m a bit worried about is things like prohibiting all experiments
          with humans, as I explain in PR <a href="/ykilcher/gpt-4chan/discussions/2">#2</a>,
          there are good reasons not to do that, and also I''m weary to tie the mis-use-ness
          of the model to how exactly the TOS of other websites are constructed, as
          I explain in PR <a href="/ykilcher/gpt-4chan/discussions/3">#3</a>. I''d
          rather find formulations that actually cover the mis-uses while leaving
          open paths for good use, even if we don''t foresee them explicitly now.
          That being said, again, if you want to put any of these conditions on the
          model, that is 100% fine with me. In that case, I''d welcome it if it was
          visually clear that those are coming from you. Or if your conditions are
          that I unconditionally accept one of the PRs, I can also do that, if the
          edit history is reflected.</p>

          Ethics people just mad I Rick rolled them.</a>" in response to valid criticism
          about GPT-4chan, it''s hard for me to believe you''re operating in good
          faith in trying to get this model restored.</p>

          <p>The demonstrable misuse of a text-generation model, as you did in <a
          rel="nofollow" href="https://youtu.be/efPrtcLdcdM">your YouTube video</a>
          to spam 30k posts on 4chan, sets back the entire text-generation industry
          as a whole. This type of outcome is the entire reason OpenAI was hesitant
          about releasing the original 1.5B GPT-2, and why OpenAI''s content filters
          on GPT-3 are overly conservative.</p>

          <p>There''s also a big ethical difference between nonconsenting, nondisclosed
          human subjects for an experiment (4chan users) and humans who participate
          in the construction of the TruthfulQA benchmark. Any potential academic
          use of this model has been tainted, so might as well shelve it.</p>

        html: '<p>Thanks,</p>

          <p>To give a bit more context, as the community spoke out about this model,
          we spent some time digging into its background, utility, and its contribution
          to research and ML, while at the same time also considering the issues the
          community had been highlighting.</p>

          <p>An approach we take with this model is relevant to all models, and so
          we wanted to make sure to move thoughtfully, but as efficiently as possible,
          to come to a solution.</p>

          <p>Based on our discussions, we seemed to mostly share priorities around:<br>(1)
          Reproducibility, open research, etc.<br>(2) Propagation of sexism, racism,
          ableism, and similar content that directly hurts people.<br>(3) Interacting
          with the developer and community to work together.</p>

          <p>Given these, we prioritized (3) and decided to reach out and try to update
          content; but given the sensitivity, this interaction had to happen quickly.<br>As
          time ran out for (3), we were left with (1) and (2).<br>At that point, the
          very clear concerns (2) outweighed the other priorities.</p>

          <p>So for now the model cannot be downloaded, but we will follow up with
          more details and steps forward soon.</p>

  content: '@meg.  I think  2)  is a very naive view. A model is a tool. Please clarify
    what you mean by "directly hurts people". A knife can be used to either hurt people
    or protect people or as a utility. Sometimes, we might think that thought policing
    is good for the community. But, I think we should lean towards not stifling open
    research because it is the research and open community that move the world forwards,
    not red tapes and thought policing'

        html: '<p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>I''m writing on behalf of Cynthia Systems, a private California corporation.
          We''ve been following this discussion closely and feel it''s essential to
          highlight some pertinent legal aspects surrounding the recent decisions
          on model availability.</p>

          <p>Firstly, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against
          governmental restrictions on speech. While private entities aren''t directly
          bound by the First Amendment in the same manner, California has provisions
          that could apply to private forums in certain contexts.</p>

          <p>Moreover, there''s a significant concern about monopolistic or anti-competitive
          behavior. If a platform, like HuggingFace, possesses a dominant position
          in the market and uses that position to unfairly stifle competition, they
          could potentially face scrutiny under U.S. federal antitrust laws.</p>

        raw: 'Hello everyone,


          I''m writing on behalf of Cynthia Systems, a private California corporation.
          We''ve been following this discussion closely and feel it''s essential to
          highlight some pertinent legal aspects surrounding the recent decisions
          on model availability.


          Firstly, the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution protects against governmental
          restrictions on speech. While private entities aren''t directly bound by
          the First Amendment in the same manner, California has provisions that could
          apply to private forums in certain contexts.


          Moreover, there''s a significant concern about monopolistic or anti-competitive
          behavior. If a platform, like HuggingFace, possesses a dominant position
          in the market and uses that position to unfairly stifle competition, they
          could potentially face scrutiny under U.S. federal antitrust laws.


          Given the importance of open research and the potential for AI models to
          contribute positively to society, we have decided to create additional backup
          copies of models that may be deemed inappropriate or controversial. We believe

          of a few select entities, which is essential for innovation, competition,
          and the overall advancement of the field.
