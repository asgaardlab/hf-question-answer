        html: '<p>@giadilli I like the change to "out of scope uses". but I don''t
          think we should make statements about other websites'' terms of service.
          The intentional breaking of such TOS really has nothing to do with which
          model is being used, and I don''t believe the concerns here suddenly vanish
          just because a website''s TOS don''t prohibit this. I''m happy to be convinced
          otherwise. I believe your concerns might be well addressed by pull request
          <a href="/ykilcher/gpt-4chan/discussions/2">#2</a>, if we can come up with
          a reasonable definition of "harm".</p>
