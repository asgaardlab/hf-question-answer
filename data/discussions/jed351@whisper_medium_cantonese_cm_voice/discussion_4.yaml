        html: '<p>Hi, I would like to use the pytorch_model.bin file in Whisper, but
          it seems the model it used is called large-v2.pt. I wonder how do I convert
          this so that it can be used in Whisper installation? </p>

          <p> I have tried whisper-cpp, the .bin file won''t take it. And OpenAI whisper
          takes .py which also not in the same format.</p>

          <p>If I want to use both, how do i convert pytorch_model.bin into format
          that whisper-cpp and OpenAI whisper to use?</p>
