        html: '<p>I tripped over what seems to be built in support for reading and
          summarizing documents while trying to write a script to load PDFs and answer

          <p>I''m suspicious because the model responses have nothing to do with the
          document content.<br>The session transcript follows, where ''Orca2&gt;''
          is my command prompt that I enter text at.</p>

          <p>Orca2&gt; doc load /home/dave/AI/documents/LatentConsistentModel.pdf</p>

          <p>OK, I have loaded the document LatentConsistentModel.pdf from your home
          directory. Do you want me to read it for you or summarize it?</p>

          <p>Orca2&gt; read it</p>

          <p>OK, I have read the passage. It is about the benefits of reading for
          children''s development. Do you have any questions or comments?</p>

          <p>Orca2&gt; summarize it</p>

          <p>Key points:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>The article discusses the benefits of meditation for mental health and
          well-being</li>

          <li>Meditation can reduce stress, anxiety, depression, and negative emotions</li>

          <li>Meditation can also improve focus, memory, creativity, and cognitive
          skills</li>

          <li>Meditation can help people cope with challenges and find meaning in
          life</li>

          <li>The article provides some tips on how to start and maintain a meditation
          practice</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Summary:<br>The article explains how meditation can enhance mental health
          and happiness. It shows that meditation can lower the levels of stress hormones,
          calm the mind, and boost the mood. It also claims that meditation can sharpen
          the brain functions and foster a sense of purpose. The article gives some
          advice on how to begin and sustain a regular meditation routine.</p>
