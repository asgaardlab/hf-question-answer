          <p>Any \n''s after <code>{output}</code>are irrelevant for inference, because
          the user doesn''t generate the output of the model.  The user (or their
          UI) just passes <code>ASSISTANT:</code> and the LLM completes from there.   So
          the \n'' shown after <code>ASSISTANT: {output}</code> in my READMEs doesn''t
          normally matter. I have to show one \n there else I can''t close the code

          <p>Jon trained with the one-line prompt template, your last example, so
          use that one.  For training, you don''t want an extra \n on the end. The
          last character should be the end-of-string token.</p>

          <p>In my READMEs I show an extra \n between <code>USER: {instruction}</code>
          and <code>ASSISTANT</code> for clarity, so it''s easier to quickly see the
          template and so the user doesn''t have to scroll a scrollbar to see the
          end.  And in practice it doesn''t affect the inference results, it will
          answer the same with or without that \n between instruction and ASSISTANT.  </p>

          <p>But Jon didn''t train with that \n between instruction and ASSISTANT
          so if you want to 100% repeat Jon''s training, I would use the one line
