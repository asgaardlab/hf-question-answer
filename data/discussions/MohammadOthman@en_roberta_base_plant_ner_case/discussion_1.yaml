        html: '<p>Hello everyone,</p>

          <p>First of all, I want to thank you for your interest in the RoBERTa-base
          Plant NER model. While the model has demonstrated excellent performance
          in identifying plants, fruits, and vegetables, I have noticed a limitation
          that needs to be addressed.</p>

          <p>During testing, it was observed that the model occasionally misidentifies
          certain animals as plants. This is an issue that I would like to resolve
          to improve the overall accuracy of the model. I would appreciate any feedback,
          suggestions, or insights from the community on this matter.</p>

          <p>In the meantime, I will be working to address this limitation by fine-tuning
          the model with more data and refining the training process. the goal is
          to ensure the highest possible accuracy and robustness in plant taxonomy
          identification.</p>

          <p>If you have encountered similar issues or have ideas on how to address
          this limitation, please share your thoughts in this discussion. Your input
          will be invaluable in helping to enhance the model''s performance and make
          it more robust.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your support and collaboration.</p>
