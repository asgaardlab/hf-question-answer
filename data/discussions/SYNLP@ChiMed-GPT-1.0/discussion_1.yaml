          as base model Zephyr 7b beta (<a href="https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta">https://huggingface.co/HuggingFaceH4/zephyr-7b-beta</a>  because
          it was trained as a multilingual model from the start) , and if you can
          finetune the model with Chinese and English data so that it can be used
          by people all around the world ?!? Theoretically it should be able to do
          some zero shot learning and when questioned in other language than the one
          in which was finetuned to answer in that language .<br>Thank you.<br>Catalin

        html: '<p>Hello Mr. Yuanhe,<br>thank you for your answer. I''m from Romania.
          I know well English language , but there are a lot of peoples that does
          not know it. And usually in the poorest countries where<br>they also have
          not enough money to go to a competent doctor or a good hospital . The great
          thing that an "AI doctor" can do is to allow all to access medical consultation<br>
          and knowledge for free or for a fraction of the expenses that they need
          to make otherways. It is also a great threat to human doctors and medical
          personal as they can be "replaced" all together by<br>AI in a foreseable
          future. The Zephyr model that I suggested to use as base "knows" around
          100 languages ...as it''s creators said . Ok. Thank you anyway for your
          great work. You are doing a great job for poor humans that are seek .<br>Have
          a good day.<br>Catalin</p>
