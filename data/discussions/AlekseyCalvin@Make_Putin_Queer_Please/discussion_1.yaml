        html: "<p>The other day I contributed a \"Make Putin Queer, Please\" model.\
          \ I consider this model a specialized tool of artistic/countercultural moral\
          \ support and resistance under the conditions of escalating violent oppression.\
          \ Now someone reported this model  as an \"ethical issue\", using language\
          \ I found jarring due to indirect associations with the very subject of\
          \ my model. On some levels, I find that I myself seem to have \"an ethical\
          \ issue\" here, not with the model, but with the complaint report.  With\
          \ all due respect to the lodger of the report,  I will try to explain. \
          \ As we all know, there is a war taking place today. And I am writing as\
          \ someone personally aware of the toll which this war \u2013 as well as\
          \ the violently enforced bigoted and exclusionary internal ideological apparatus\
          \ of the current Russian regime \u2013is taking on dozens of millions of\
          \ people, not to mention the millions of queer persons more specifically\
          \ living today throughout Russia, Belarus, and Ukraine today, many or most\
          \ of whom are afforded no real choice or options other than to somehow try\
          \ to survive under these conditions, with very few specialized public tools\
          \ or ways to even vent their frustration. Or perhaps give some expression\
          \ to some persevering measure of optimism.  Some of us sincerely believe\
          \ that everyone is queer. Some of us might even console themselves by fancying\
          \ that Putin himself might actually be queer, whether in a closeted or a\
          \ repressed way, and if he were to recognize this, then maybe the whole\
          \ ideology would shift, Russia would retreat out of Ukraine,  the war would\
          \ end, and the streets become safer and more open to pride parades again.\
          \ Such a belief might sound absurd. It probably is. But it's a sort of thing\
          \ that can, believe it or not, make some people feel better under really\
          \ extreme conditions of widespread anxiety, and likely surrounding devastation,\
          \ plus ever-encroaching despair.  As such, I can not accept the reported\
          \ complaint as legitimate. On a side note, I wish more people would recognize\
          \ that any active effort to remain \"apolitical\" (or to render any given\
          \ public space as such) is never a fully transparent or self-sufficient\
          \ stance, but always and inherently (as an indirect contribution to some\
          \ cumulative effect or socio-cultural set of conditions) an implicit gesture\
          \ of support to one faction or another. With that said, I am not accusing\
          \ the report-lodger of anything in a personal way, nor am I presuming anything\
          \ about their real beliefs and sympathies. What I am stating is that I am\
          \ sincerely jarred by having to confront this given instance of exclusionary\
          \ language, not altogether dissimilar to the often nonchalant and cordial\
          \ complaints routinely lodged to the Russian Security Service (the FSB)\
          \ by superficially or/and avowedly \"apolitical\" Russian citizens \"concerned\"\
          \ about \"pro-queer propaganda\" and the like. These model citizens would\
          \ nonchalantly and quietly fume up, then go down the street (or, these days,\
          \ online) to file their FSB complaints, writing things like \"this is not\
          \ the kind of movie we need in this theater\", \"this is not the kind of\
          \ book we need in this store\" or \"this school\", \"this is not the kind\
          \ of person we need living in our apartment house\", and so on... And sometimes\
          \ real people end up in prison or worse.  I know that I am under no such\
          \ threat here in this given instance. But the wording and the nature of\
          \ this complaint still gives me quite a pause. I am thus forced to report\
          \ the report and to hope that those who moderate and mediate such things\
          \ here happen to... well... share a sympathizing to me conception of what\
          \ such abstractions as \"political\", \"free\", \"unconditional\" and \"\
          appropriate\", \"safe\"  and \"oppressed\" can and sometimes do mean, and\
