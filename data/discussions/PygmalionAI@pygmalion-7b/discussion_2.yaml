          I have to distribute XORs because of the license. Hopefully RedPajama or

          @Jackdiy I don''t think it''d be a great move. Vicuna is trained _exclusively_
          for ChatGPT-like chats as far as I understand, and the use-case for this
          model is more entertainment/fictional characters. Our training data already
          includes some of Vicuna''s data, but in very moderate amounts as to not
          bias the model towards sterile ChatGPT-like responses.'
