        html: '<p>Sorry for the dumb question, but if I used <code>Envvi/Inkpunk-Diffusion</code>
          as the $MODEL_NAME (not the ckpt filename, just the folder path), did it
          pick up <code>Inkpunk-Diffusion-v2.ckpt</code> to use and not the v1 ckpt
          which is also in that folder?  I see <code>pretrained_model_name_or_path</code>
          in the source code has some logic, but not sure what it all means. Just
          being a little OCD or paranoid or whatever.</p>

          <p>Thanks!</p>
