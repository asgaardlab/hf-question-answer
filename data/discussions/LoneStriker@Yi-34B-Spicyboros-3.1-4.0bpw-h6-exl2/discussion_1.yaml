  content: "@LoneStriker  I noticed weird behavior when it comes to prompt format\
    \ on this model. \nIt doesn't like chatml prompt format - and in my testing it\
    \ also doesn't seem to like llama 2 chat or alpaca formats. I was troubleshooting\
    \ an issue today where I was getting weird responses when interacting with this\
    \ model through cli with chat.py supplied with exllama v2. I found that the prompt\
    \ format it likes the most is the default oobabooga chat prompt format \"Assistant\"\
    . That's the one that gives you a familiar start message\n\n>AI\n>How can I help\
    \ you today?\n \nWhen you are running this model in ooba, are you sure that you\
    \ switched to the `instruct` mode in settings on the bottom?\nIf not, and it's\
    \ running in `chat` mode, you are likely also using the default Assistant prompt\
    \ format.\n\nI fixed the issue for my use with chat.py by adding a custom prompt\
    \ format, mirroring the ooba Assistant prompt format, I find it to work better\
    \ with this model than other prompt formats. \nHere's an example of the results\
    \ that I get when using various prompt formats with ooba with this model. 2 prompts\
    \ per prompt format. Can you try to replicate this?\n\n----------------------\n\

    \ in Ghambia in May on average?\n\nGhambia, located along the Atlantic coast of\
    \ West Africa, experiences its hottest temperatures during the months of April\
    \ and May. The average high temperature for these two months hovers around 30\xB0\
    C (86\xB0F), while the average low drops to about 21\xB0C (70\xB0F) at night.\
    \ This indicates that Ghambia can be quite warm in May, with daytime temperatures\
    \ typically reaching into the mid-to-high 80s Fahrenheit or low 90s Celsius. However,\
    \ due to its coastal location, humidity levels are also relatively high which\
    \ might make the heat feel even more intense.\n\nReference(s):\n\nhttps://www.climatestotravel.com/ghana/temperature-by-month\n\

        raw: Thanks. I didn't notice that extra setting previously. I'm not sure what
          the default format is if you don't set that.  I'm rerunning the fine-tuning
          with `conversation` set, but it's going to take a while to finish.

          <p>I also have a small question that doesn''t deserve a separate discussion
          - is the model name spicyboros as opposed to airoboros purely an aesthetic
          choice and the model was trained on airoboros 3.1 dataset, or was this model
          actually trained on de-alignment dataset from spicyboros-2.2? Jon Durbin
          later removed that dataset from HF (I have it saved up though). I believe
          that happened right after a research paper came out that was basically putting
          a blame for releasing unrestricted models on him. So, I don''t think spicyboros
          had any releases after 2.2</p>
