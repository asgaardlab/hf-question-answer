        html: '<p>As you said, it''s a chat version. But when I chat with it, like
          asking "What''s your name?", the output is nonsense.</p>

          <pre><code>What''s your name?


          A:


          Your code is correct. The problem is that the value of "name" is a string,
          and it is being used as a variable name. You need to assign the value of
          the "name" variable to something else.

          In this case, you can use a different variable name, like "name2".

          name2 = name.split(" ")


          If you want to get the last word in the string, you can use the "last" method.

          name2 = name.split(" ")

          last_word = name2[-1]


          A:


          name = "joe"

          name = name.split(" ")

          name = name[-1]

          print(name)


          Output:

          jo


          Or

          name = "joe"

          name = name.split(" ")

          name[-1] = name[-1].replace(" ", "")

          print(name)


          Output:

          1. Field of the Invention

          The present invention relates to a method and apparatus for providing a
          user with a service in a wireless communication system, and more particularly,
          to a method and apparatus for providing a service in a wireless communication
          system in which a mobile station is located in a coverage area of a base
          station.

          2. Description of the Related Art

          A wireless communication system is widely used to provide voice and data
          services to Mobile Stations (MSs) such as a mobile phone, a Personal Digital
          Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, and a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP).
          A mobile communication system can be categorized as a wireless Local Area
          Network (LAN) system and a wireless Metropolitan Area Network (MAN) system
          according to the mobility of the MSs. The wireless LAN system is a system
          in which the MSs move within a limited area, such as a home or an office,
          and thus the MSs are connected to the Internet or an intranet. The wireless
          MAN system is a system in which the MSs move freely within a wide area,
          such as a building, a campus, and a city, and thus the MSs are connected
          to a core network of the mobile communication system.

          The wireless MAN system includes a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)
          and a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN). The WMAN includes a Wireless
          Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN) and a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network
          (WMAN). The WMAN is a wireless communication system that provides a service
          in a limited area such as a home or an office, and includes a Wireless Metropolitan
          Area Network (WMAN). The WMAN is a wireless communication system that provides
          a service in a wide area such as a metropolitan area and a town or a city,
          and includes a Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN).

          A mobile station (MS) is a wireless communication device that can transmit
          and receive data. The MSs include a cellular phone, a Personal Digital Assistant
          (PDA), a laptop computer, and a Portable Multimedia Player (PMP). The MSs
          are classified into a mobile station (MS) and a portable station (PS) according
          to mobility. The MS is classified into a mobile station (MS) and a portable
          station (PS) according to mobility.

          The MS is a wireless communication device that can receive a service in
          a wireless communication system. The MS includes a cellular phone, a Personal
          Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, and a Portable Multimedia Player
          (PMP). The MS is a wireless communication device that can receive a service
          in a wireless communication system. The MS includes a cellular phone, a
          Personal Digital Assistant (PDA), a laptop computer, and a Portable Multimedia
          Player (PMP).

          The MS is connected to a Core Network (CN) of a mobile communication system.
          The MS is connected to the CN through a Radio Network Controller (RNC).
          The RNC is connected to a Base Station (BS) through a Node B. The BS is
          connected to the MS through a radio channel. The BS is connected to the
          CN through a Core Network (CN). The BS is connected to the MS through a
          radio channel.

          The RNC is connected to the CN through a Node B. The RNC is connected to
          the BS through a Node B. The RNC is connected to the BS through a Node B.
          The RNC is connected to the BS through a Node B. The RNC is connected to
          the BS through a Node B. The RNC is connected to the BS through a Node B.
          The RNC is connected to the BS through a Node B.

          The BS is connected to the CN through a Core Network (CN). The BS is connected
          to the CN through a Core Network (CN). The BS is connected to the CN through
          a Core Network (CN). The BS is connected to the CN through a Core Network
