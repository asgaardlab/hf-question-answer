        html: '<h1 id="duplicate-results-on-higher-resolution">Duplicate Results on
          higher resolution</h1>

          <p>When i try to generate the image using <code>512x768</code> or <code>768x768</code>,
          It enhance the results but also duplicate the image, person or object in
          the image.<br>Is there a way to handle this problem.  I try <code>negative_prompt</code>
          so that it do not include "Duplicates", but sometimes it still give me duplicate.<br>Anyone
          know how to fix this or any improved negative_prompt.</p>
