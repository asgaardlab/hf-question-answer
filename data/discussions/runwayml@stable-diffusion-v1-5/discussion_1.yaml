  content: "Hi all,\n\nCris here - the CEO and Co-founder of [Runway](https://runwayml.com/).\
    \ Since our founding in 2018, we\u2019ve been on a mission to empower anyone to\
    \ create the impossible. So, we\u2019re excited to share this newest version of\
    \ Stable Diffusion so that we can continue delivering on our mission.\n\nThis\
    \ version of Stable Diffusion is a continuation of the original [High-Resolution\
    \ Image Synthesis with Latent Diffusion Models](https://research.runwayml.com/publications/high-resolution-image-synthesis-with-latent-diffusion-models)\
    \ work that we created and published (now more commonly referred to as [Stable\
    \ Diffusion](https://research.runwayml.com/the-research-origins-of-stable-difussion)).\
    \ Stable Diffusion is an AI model developed by [Patrick Esser from Runway](https://research.runwayml.com/the-research-origins-of-stable-difussion)\
    \ and [Robin Rombach](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ygdQhrIAAAAJ&hl=en)\
    \ from LMU Munich. The research and code behind Stable Diffusion was [open-sourced](https://github.com/CompVis/latent-diffusion)\
    \ last year. [The model was released under the CreativeML Open RAIL M License.](https://github.com/CompVis/stable-diffusion/blob/main/LICENSE)\n\
    \nWe confirm there has been no breach of IP as flagged and we thank Stability\
    \ AI for the compute donation to retrain the original model."

          2. HuggingFace is not a university research group

    This isn''t close to being true

    1. HuggingFace is not affiliated with the development of the model

    2. HuggingFace is not a university research group

    3. HuggingFace is not funded by Stability and Runway

    4. Neither side is complaining about HuggingFace''s actions


    HuggingFace''s role here is similar to Github''s or YouTube''s. They own a website
    where people upload things. This model upload caused a dispute over ownership
    and Stability asked them to take it down, maybe because either a) they didn''t
    understand the licensing or b) they thought that the model was something it''s
    not (I don''t think this is the same model as what''s currently offered in DreamStudio?).
    Then Stability backed down, likely because of a combo of realizing they were going
    to get a lot of bad press and clearing up their confusion about the previous points.


    HuggingFace has an ethical obligation (that they intermittently take seriously)
    to not allow people to post models and datasets in violation of the licensing
    of those models and datasets on their website. The standard mechanism for enforcing
    such an action is to issue a takedown request, and it''s very common for things
    to be taken down pending evaluating the takedown request because in the overwhelming
    majority of cases the harm done by improper release is more severe than the harm
    done in needlessly delaying release.'

          <p>I suspect 1.5 won''t be released until they find ways to make it much
          harder / impossible to produce content of such a questionable nature.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>Problem is... The genie was already out of the bottle the moment 1.4
          was released. People found out how to turn off the NSFW filter and generate
          highly questionable content in no time. And no matter how you want to restrict
          this legally or practically, there will be people who will use it this way,
          much like there will always be people who use "pirated" software.</p>

          <p>Trying to make it impossible to turn off the NSFW filter of future versions
          of SD and/or similar restrictions intended to reduce the potential for what
          you guys perceive as "abuse" will only result in fewer people deciding to
          upgrade. This in turn will have a negative impact for everyone, since it
          results in a more fractured AI landscape.</p>

          <p>Because of this, it''s better to embrace the situation as it is and acknowledge
          that most people outside the puritanical USA will turn off the NSFW filter
          by default anyway. Those who abuse this are a minority anyway. And, considering
          the genie is already out of the bottle, it makes far more sense to focus
          on detecting illegal and/or immoral usage of AI and providing a legal framework
          that allows prosecution thereof than to focus on restricting what''s possible
          with SD and therewith limit not just illegitimate usages thereof but also
          many legitimate uses, like eg. artistic nudes.</p>

          <p>Thus, IMO StabilityAI''s official position is based on a naive and very
          nonsensical perspective and RunwayML was totally justified in releasing
          1.5 to the public as was promised for weeks!</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>I don''t imagine that such changes would have been hard to implement
          from the start, if there had been any interest in doing so. Remove or genericize
          the relevant words from the training captions, run a couple iterations of
          face and text detection on the training images, and blur them like the faces
          and license plates on Streetview. Not even human could expect to see through
          the walls of Plato''s Cave with their wonderful million-trillion-parameter
          organic brain.</p>

          <p>What this smacks of is too depressing to write about here, and what it
          would do to the capability and performance of these models would probably
          (and sadly) be found out soon enough. Then it''s not as if someone else
          would not have replicated the model without such limitations, like how GPT-2
          1.5B was not released due to essentially similar concerns, until someone
          replicated the results and released their model.</p>

          <p>I like the way stable diffusion is doing it. You have a safety filter
          after generation, which makes sure you don''t get nsfw images, unless you
          really want to. The model is capable of everything (within its limits),
          users can decide themself to patch the software, and web services can decide
          to turn off the filter or to enforce it.</p>

          <p>The problem starts, if the future is really filtering training material
          and creating models, which are not capable of nude skin. This will probably
          not only prevent the generation of nude images (whatever reason, if artistic,
          pornographic, both, or something else), but worsen the performance in other
          areas as well, because they depend on information that is similar to nudity.</p>

          <p>Just compare the approaches of the big networks:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Dall-E filters text input and adds words like "woman" trying to improve
          diversity.</li>

          <li>stable diffusion filters undesirable output and diversity can be increased
          by steering the network into that direction.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>I like the approach more, that the network is capable of everything,
          input is unfiltered, but output can be filtered.<br>The most interesting
          approach would be to have additional input parameters, which steers the
          network into (N)SFW areas. I think of something like backpropagating the
          loss of the safety checker into a single "Safety Level" input.</p>

          my humble opinion, it is not up to tech corps or politicians to determine
          where to draw that line. Censorship of nudity based on what a select group
          of corporate or political leaders consider "appropriate" content reeks of
          totalitarianism, really, and reminds me of some of the darkest chapters
          of Theocratic, Communist &amp; Fascist dictatorships alike. It''s not something
