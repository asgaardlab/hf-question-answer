        html: '<p>I just recently heard of Stable Diffusion and would like to try
          it out. I have created a profile and accepted the terms. I am more so interested
          in transforming videos. </p>

          <p>Which one of these 2 do I need?</p>

          <p>Download the weights<br>v1-5-pruned-emaonly.ckpt - 4.27GB, ema-only weight.
          uses less VRAM - suitable for inference<br>v1-5-pruned.ckpt - 7.7GB, ema+non-ema
          weights. uses more VRAM - suitable for fine-tuning</p>

          <p>Also, how to I link it to my google drive??</p>

          <p>Thank you</p>
