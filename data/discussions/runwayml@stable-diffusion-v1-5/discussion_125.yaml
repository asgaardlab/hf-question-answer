        html: '<p>When I generate more than 2 iterations the output gallery flicks
          along the generated pictures none stop, the only way I can stop it is pressing
          Esc, then if I click a picture I want to send to img2img away it goes again,
          the only way I can do it is Esc then drag and drop the picture into img2ime
          or inpainting. Anyone give me a heads up how to solve this prob'' please?</p>
