        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>The stable-diffusion-v1-5 space has the following text at the bottom:</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>The model was trained on the LAION-5B dataset, which scraped non-curated
          image-text-pairs from the internet (the exception being the removal of illegal
          content) and is meant for research purposes.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>This interpretation fits with recent analyses, including HuggingFace''s
          Head of Product design [1], as well as my own legal research.</p>

          <p>So could you clarify the legal basis for releasing the model under the
          OpenRAIL-M license instead? I don''t believe Runway has the necessary rights
          to do so. (I''d recommend removing &amp; declaring the past license void.)</p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Alex Champandard</p>

          <p>P.S. There is a formal investigation underway to what extent illegal
          content was removed from the dataset or not, and whether this was handled
          in a legal manner. Thus, I hope that Runway takes this matter seriously
          and acts quickly.</p>
