        html: '<p>Hi Everyone </p>

          <p>Am trying to change a photo I took which I uploaded into Stable Deffusion.
          ie trying to create an older version of the photo I took of the town''s
          main to say  a realistic photo from say 50 years ago  Every time upload
          the photo and  put in the prompt it generates a completely new image rather
          than editing the image I uploaded.</p>

          <p>Not sure if this is possible at this stage </p>

          <p>Any help very much appreciated.</p>

          <p>Mike</p>
