        html: '<p>Hey! Not sure if this is a valid question or the right forum, but
          I''m getting quite strange results trying out the model. </p>

          <p>When translating longer texts (multiple sentences), quite often it translates
          1-2 sentences before starting to repeat itself (either a specific word or
          a sentence) until max_length is reached.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/1669040684887-637b829fe2c47044e72cb225.png"><img

          <p>Characters like | or &amp; seems to trigger this behavior sometimes,
          but sometimes this happens without any such characters present.<br>Email
          addresses seems to be a problem too, with "<a rel="nofollow" href="mailto:jean@medecin.fr">jean@medecin.fr</a>"
          becoming  "The following information is provided for each Member State:"
          when translating from French to English.</p>

          <p>I''m just wondering if anyone else have experienced something similar?
          Haven''t seen these problems with M2M100, for example.</p>

          <p>Thanks! </p>
