        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I was recently browsing nlln models on HuggingFace and I came across
          this model: "facebook/nllb-200-3.3B". I noticed a discrepancy that I''d
          like to bring to your attention.</p>

          <p>According to the model''s name, it''s supposed to be a NLLB model. However,
          in the config.json file, the model_type and architecture are labeled as
          ''M2M'', not ''NLLB''.</p>

          <p>Here are the pertinent details:<br>Model name: <em>facebook/nllb-200-3.3B</em><br>model_type
          in config.json: <em>m2m_100</em><br>architectures in config.json: <em>M2M100ForConditionalGeneration</em></p>

          <p>I noticed that Hugging Face does provide a label for NLLB models. This
          discrepancy could potentially lead to confusion when users are trying to
          understand the underlying architecture of this model.</p>

          <p>I wanted to bring this to your attention in case it was an oversight.
          If it''s not an oversight and there''s a specific reason for this labeling,
          I''d appreciate it if you could clarify.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your time and the work you''ve put into developing this
          model. I look forward to your response.</p>
