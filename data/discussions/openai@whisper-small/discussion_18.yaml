        html: '<p>Hey Sanchit,</p>

          <p>My question was if there are any whisper models adjusted so it can run
          on GoogleCoral/EdgeTPU? I see you pointing me towards Google Colab :) -
          which i know it works. Google Coral is an usb TPU accelerator made by Google.
          The issue with the whisper tflite quantized models i could find, was that
          models contained flex-ops - which are not supported by Coral.</p>

          <p>Looking at your impressive work, I would like to ask 2 questions:<br>1
          - is it possible to have a romanian tiny pretrained model (Mozilla has an
          open dataset)?<br>2 - is there any way of adjusting the whisper model not
          to use flex / dynamic tensors, so it can be compatible with Google Coral
          (i can help with testing or whatever needed). Running whisper on Coral would
          be a great feature, making whisper available for offline embedded devices
          (imagine offline alexa in local language).</p>

          <p> Thanks!!<br>Virgil</p>
