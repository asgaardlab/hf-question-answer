        html: '<p>I noticed with Elysium_Anime_V3 that it appears to either ignore
          or heavily de-emphasize the first word in a prompt. For example, if you
          do skeleton you will get a girl but do "a skeleton" you will get a skeleton.

        html: '<p>Thanks, this helps a lot. I was testing V2 vs V3 earlier and just
          concluded that V3 was bad because it didn''t know some concepts that V2
          did but knowing this it looks like it was just ignoring the first word of
          my prompt and that''s why they did not work. For example "cyborg soldier"
          will just give a regular soldier.<br>Also while the first word of your prompt
          doesn''t appear in the generated image it does change the image a little,
          for example "a soldier" and "alien soldier" produce largely the same soldier
          but it is not identical. Some first words change the composition more but
          still don''t really appear in the image.</p>
