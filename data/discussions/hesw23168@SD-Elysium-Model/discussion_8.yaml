        html: '<p>Nope, not like that at all. But I love the look you got there and
          you''re making me curious about how to achieve that kind of look, espcially
          the eyes! That little fae girl is just uncannily adorable! Is this 100%
          AI generated, or is there some touch-up on the picture?</p>

          <p>I was trying to reach the author of the SD Elysium models series (Elysium_V1
          and Elysium_Anime_V1, _V2 and _V3). Since the models were not available
          on CivitAI.com, which is a much more convivial site for searching, comparing
          and downloading SD models, I uploaded it there. Since I''m kinda new with
          the site and the upload tools, I did not hide the<br>model until I finished
          uploading and documenting everything and unfortunately, I forgot to put
          the link back to Hugging Face and the author name give attribution correctly.</p>

          <p>Then, a self-proclaimed white knight came down with insults and bad mouthed
          me about stealing someones model to make easy internet point. Now, that
          person is not the author, does not seem to know the author and basically
          just seems to be a general busybody. But, he did raise a few valid points
          in between the insults and general uncouth speach. So I did my due diligence.
          </p>

          <p>I posted this to know the author whishes about the model. Sould he reply,
          I WILL comply with his wishes, the following nonwithstanding. However, this
          made me research and review the OpenRAIL-M (for Models) license, which is
          basically similar to CC ATTRIB SA (Attribution, Share-Alike), plus the option
          to restrict any specific use of the AI artifact (the model in this case)
          the original author wants to prevent upfront. At its most basic, it includes
          not using the model to impersonate a real person nor, through the use or
          misuse of the model, to cause or allow any harm or prejudice to affect a
          real person. So I checked, and we are talking about the standard OpenRAIL-M
          license here, with no extra restrictions. This, unfortunately for our busybody,
          means I can legally and morally distribute, modify, merge, train, alter,
          and even sell the model or include it in a commercial, for-profit, product,
          as long as I : - Attribute the AI artifact to the original author, - Ensure
          that at minimum, the same licence with the same restrictions is applied
          to the distribution. </p>

          <p>All this to say I don''t even need to ask the author for permission to
          do anything with the model as long as I follow those rules.</p>

          <p>Sorry for the rant, you probably did not even want to hear all this.
          But it does good this get this off my mind, and I think it included much
          information that needs to be better understood by the community...</p>
