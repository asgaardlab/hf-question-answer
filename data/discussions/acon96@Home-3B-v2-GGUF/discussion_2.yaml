        html: '<p>I loaded up v2 in lmstudio and just started by saying hello to it.
          It proceeds to start spitting out it''s own questions and answers which
          consist of a lot of random information... This doesn''t stop it has to be
          stopped manually and it consistently does this. It seems rather than just
          giving the answer or responding to a request, doesn''t know to stop. Not
          sure how I would be having this issue if nobody else has noticed but it''s
          the only model I have this happen with. The v1 doesn''t do this, but v1
          also doesn''t work properly with my home assistant as it often gives in
          correct information about statuses of devices, as if it is guessing at the
          states. Would like to try v2 if you could provide any insight to why it
          would be doing this. </p>
