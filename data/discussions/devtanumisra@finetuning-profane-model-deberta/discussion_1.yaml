        html: '<p>hello there and thanks for the great work.</p>

          <p>I wanted to ask what was the input sequence to the tokenizer.<br>How
          did you manage to combine the sentence with the aspect?</p>

          <p>I tried to use them as a pair of sentences<br>for example:</p>

          <p>text = "my name is Naif and I love math but I hate science."<br>aspect
          = "math"<br>tokenizer(text, aspect)</p>

          <p>is  this the correct way to do so?</p>
