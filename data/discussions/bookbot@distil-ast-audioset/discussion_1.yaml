          >guide</a> from HuggingFace which shows you how to fine-tune a model for\

          \ with this <a href=\"https://huggingface.co/docs/datasets/audio_dataset\"\
          >guide</a>. If the issue is that the training is not converging properly\
          \ and you are sure that the dataset has been prepared correctly, you might\
          \ want to try and fine-tune a different model, i.e. not from our <code>distil-ast-audioset</code>.\
          \ In the first guide which I gave, they fine-tuned <code>facebook/wav2vec2-base</code>,\
          \ you can try that out as well. I hope this helps. Cheers.</p>\n"
