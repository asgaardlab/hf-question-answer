        html: '<p>Hello Brett, sorry for the late replay.</p>

          <p>Sadly, I do not have the original model anymore, since I have reworked
          my process of uploading and downloading models from the HuggingFace hub
          so it is more generalized. You can find more information in the README.</p>

          <p>But I will train and upload a new model <code>algorithm.zip</code> which
          you should be able to load again with <code>load_from_hub(repo_id="zap-thamm/PPO-Taxi-v3",
          filename="algorithm.zip")</code> or alternatively with the method described
          in the README. I will use the same StableBaseline3 hyperparameters, as have
          been used for "PPO-Taxi-v3.zip".</p>

          <pre><code>model = PPO("MlpPolicy", env, "learning_rate": 0.001, "n_steps":
          1024, "batch_size": 64, "n_epochs": 4, "gamma": 0.999, "gae_lambda": 0.98,
