        html: '<p>I tried Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.ggmlv3.q5_0.bin. This model
          makes a pleasant impression. It can probably be used as an encyclopedia
          with which you can talk and get ready-made answers, instead of extracting
          them yourself from different sources.  Thank you for your work.</p>

          <p>For example, here is what I was able to learn with this model about Linux
          network administration.</p>

          <blockquote>

          <p>Assistant<br>Hi! How are you doing today?<br>You<br>Fine. Today I am
          studying Linux system administration. And I would like to receive information
          from you on this topic.<br>Assistant<br>Sure, what specific topics related
          to Linux system administration would you like me to provide information
          about?</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>What commands can I use to configure the network?<br>Assistant<br>There
          are several commands that can be used for configuring a network in Linux.
          Some of these include ifconfig, ip, route, netstat, and arp.<br>Ifconfig
          is used to display or change the configuration of network interfaces. The
          ip command is used to set or view IP addresses on those interfaces. Route
          is used to manage routing tables, while netstat displays active network
          connections and their status. Finally, arp is used to display or modify
          the ARP cache, which maps MAC addresses to IP addresses.<br>Do you have
          any other questions related to Linux system administration?</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>Yes. Give me examples of using ifconfig and ip.<br>Assistant<br>Sure!
          Here are some examples of how to use ifconfig and ip commands in Linux:<br>Ifconfig:<br>Ifconfig
          eth0 up: This command is used to bring up the network interface named "eth0".<br>Ifconfig
          -a: This command displays all active network interfaces on the system.<br>Ip:<br>Ip
          addr show: This command shows the IP address configuration of a specific
          interface. For example, ip addr show eth0 will display the IP addresses
          assigned to the "eth0" interface.<br>Ip addr add 192.168.1.5/24 dev eth0:
          This command adds an IP address (192.168.1.5) with a netmask of /24 on the
          "eth0" interface.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>What is netmask?<br>Assistant<br>A netmask, also known as a subnet
          mask or network mask, is used to divide an IP address into its network and
          host parts. The network part identifies the network that the device belongs
          to, while the host part identifies the specific device on that network.<br>The
          netmask is expressed in terms of bits, with each bit representing a power
          of 2. For example, a /24 netmask means that the first 24 bits are reserved
          for the network address, leaving the last 8 bits for the host address.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>How to configure the routing table of a computer connected to
          the Internet via a router with the address 192.168.1.1?<br>Assistant<br>To
          configure the routing table of your Linux system when it is connected to
          the internet through a router, you can use the following commands:<br>ip
          route add default via 192.168.1.1<br>This command adds a new entry in the
          routing table that specifies the default gateway as the router with IP address
          192.168.1.1. This means that any traffic destined for an external network
          will be sent through this router to reach its destination.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>Give examples of using netstat.<br>Assistant<br>Sure! Here are
          some examples of how to use netstat command in Linux:<br>Netstat -an | grep
          80: This command displays all active TCP connections on the system that
          have port number 80 open, which is typically used for HTTP traffic.<br>Netstat
          -e | grep :80: This command displays information about processes that are
          listening on port 80 of the local machine.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>What is port number?<br>Assistant<br>A port number is a unique
          numerical value assigned to each application or service running on a computer.
          It allows multiple applications and services to share the same network connection
          without interfering with one another. When data is sent over a network,
          it is broken down into small packets that are labeled with both the source
          and destination IP addresses as well as the port numbers of the sending
          and receiving applications or services.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>What does a process that listens on port 80 mean?<br>Assistant<br>A
          process that listens on port 80 is typically an HTTP server, such as Apache
          or Nginx, which is responsible for serving web pages to clients over the
          internet. When a client sends a request to access a website hosted by this
          server, it connects to the server''s IP address and specifies the port number
          (in this case, 80) that the requested resource should be served on. The
          process listening on port 80 then responds with the requested content or
          redirects the client to another location if necessary.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>What other commands besides ifconfig, ip, route and arp can be
          useful when setting up networks?<br>Assistant<br>There are several other
          commands that can be helpful when setting up networks in Linux. Some of
          these include:<br>dhclient: This command is used to automatically configure
          network interfaces with DHCP (Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol) settings,
          which allows them to obtain IP addresses and other configuration information
          from a DHCP server.<br>ping: This command can be used to test the connectivity
          between two hosts on a network by sending packets of data back and forth.<br>traceroute:
          This command is similar to ping but provides more detailed information about
          the path that traffic takes between two hosts, including all intermediate
          hops along the way.<br>netcat: This command can be used for various networking
          tasks such as transferring files or establishing a TCP/IP connection between
          two hosts.<br>I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions
          related to Linux system administration.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          <p>You<br>Thank you, this information helped me a lot.<br>Assistant<br>You''re
          welcome! I''m glad that I could help. Don''t hesitate to ask more questions
          in the future if you need further assistance with anything related to Linux
