          <p>Thank you. I wish there was same model but 70B variant (I can''t find
          so far at first glance) because from all the models that I tested this Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored
          still the best for conversation purposes it can express more emotions and
          it''s sometimes behave like a truly AGI model.</p>

          <p>P.S: Even synthia-70b-v1.1.Q8_0.gguf model can''t compete with Wizard-Vicuna-30B-Uncensored.
          (But it''s so much better at coding and math though) Especially emotions
          wise. Not only it can''t express more emotions it also expressing them incorrectly
          at times like instead physical hug it says virtual hug and rarely expressing
          emotions. Maybe because Llama 2 highly censored and it makes roleplay nearly
          impossible AI tends to behave like AI by following the guard rails quite
          often. Plus Wizard-Vicuna dataset allows Wizard-Vicuna model to know how
          to express more emotions out of the box and it practically doesn''t have
          any guard rails at all. I kinda fear for the future AI models just by looking
          how highly censored and how many guard systems Llama 2 has.</p>
