        html: '<p>Hi, thanks for making this!</p>

          <p>I''ve been experimenting with using embeddings by downloading .pt files
          from huggingface, dropping them in my embeddings folder, and then calling
          them in the prompt.</p>

          <p>But I''m not seeing any .pt files in your set here?  I''m guessing I
          do something with the ckpt file instead, but not sure where to put it?</p>

          <p>I''m googling and asking chatgpt, but not getting any clear direct onboarding
          tutorials on how to use huggingface downloads, so maybe this question is
          off the mark.  Basically, how do I actually use this model in Stable Diffusion?</p>

          <p>Or can you please point me to any beginner onboarding guides?  (Again,
          not easily coming up in search)</p>

          <p>Thanks in advance, much appreciated.</p>
