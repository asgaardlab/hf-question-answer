        html: '<p>The issue is training data- I think 30 examples of a race is good
          enough to train, so lesser known races can be tough. You might be able to
          use warforged as a base and prompt around to try and get a guy like that.
          I''ve been able to prompt it to make wooden warforged or warforged made
          of lava. Might be worth a shot :) </p>
