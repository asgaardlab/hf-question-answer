        html: '<p>Hi ! If I''m being right, your model aims at identifying which act
          of language is expressed in a text/sentence. Would you mind uploading the
          mapping between output labels ("LABEL_0", "LABEL_1" and so on) and the corresponding
          acts (directive, commissive, expressive, declarative, verdictive, representative),
          or expliciting what are the categories (in case the objective is different)
          ?</p>

          <p>Thanks a lot,<br>Best,<br>Florent</p>
