        html: '<p>The model is based on an open source version of StableLM under the
          CC BY-SA 4.0 license.</p>

          <p>While I don''t think models are (or should be) copyrightable, we''d better
          act as if they are, which is why licensing is being dealt with to begin
          with.</p>

          <p>While the CC BY-SA 4.0 is a free and open license, it is (unlike, for
          example, Apache 2.0, MIT or CC BY 4.0) a copyleft license.</p>

          <p>The model cart asserts that the license for this model is CC BY-SA 4.0,
          but the tag still incorrectly states "apache-2.0". It''s the latter that
          should be fixed.</p>

          <p>It must be noted that while Pythia versions of Open Assistant are purposefully
          under non-copyleft licenses, StableLM-based ones are under a copyleft license.
          This is ok, it''s just important to be clear with those who may use the
          model.</p>

          <p>(Note: if assets in the dataset are <em>also</em> derived by assets under
          Apache 2.0, this raises the question of compatibility between the two licenses.
          If they are directly compatible, CC BY-SA 4.0 is fine for this project.
          If not, GPL 3.0 would solve the issue as both licenses are compatible with
          it).</p>
