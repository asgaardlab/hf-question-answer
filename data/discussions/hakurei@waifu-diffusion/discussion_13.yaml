          <p>According to the (Novel AI) blog post at the following link, this effect
          is due to "Aspect Ratio Bucketing": <a rel="nofollow" href="https://blog.novelai.net/novelai-improvements-on-stable-diffusion-e10d38db82ac">https://blog.novelai.net/novelai-improvements-on-stable-diffusion-e10d38db82ac</a></p>

          <p>Basically, it''s probably not you but an artifact of how the images were
          scanned in.  There are two ways that I use to try to make things better.  First
          is to try different seeds and or prompts- but mainly different seeds.  When
          I get a seed with the pose in the sampler of my choice at around 20 steps,
          I stick with that.  Steps is obviously up to you.  The other thing is to
          use a ''guide'' image in IMG2IMG to sort of ''force'' SD to put the (object)
          in the place you were thinking of.  Remember to keep the Denoising Strength
          around .7 or below, or SD won''t pay enough attention to the ''guide'' image
          to make a difference.  Hope that helps!</p>
