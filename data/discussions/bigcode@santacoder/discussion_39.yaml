        html: '<p>I''m looking for a way to stop the generation whenever my task/prompt
          is fullfilled. Except from stop_words and max_length is there another stopping
          criteria that could be used to stop the generation. More specifically I
          want to ''force'' the model to generate an end_of_sequence token before
          the max_length is reached. </p>

          <p>Any ideas ?</p>
