        html: '<p>Hello everyone,<br>I''m currently in the process of doing my master''s
          thesis about LLM applied to code. In my experiments, I am comparing the
          code summarization and code synthetization tasks in Java for multiple models.
          Since one of the models I will be using is InCoder, I thought the use of
          SantaCoder could be interesting to further prove the claim that they are
          comparable.</p>

          <p>I would like to ask if you have some advice on the use of SantaCoder
          for these tasks. In the sense of hyperparameters or prompt engineering.
          I checked the SantaCoder demo where I realized that you set a low temperature
          for the infill tasks but not for the code generation one. Therefore, I was
          wondering if you have any other insights that may improve the performance
          of the model.</p>

          <p>Best regards.</p>
