        html: '<p>First of all, thanks so much for introducing this project! The learnings
          are really interesting and I enjoy quite a lot reading the preprints and
          playing with the code. </p>

          <p>A quick question on the MQA architecture: I understand that it is a great
          impl. for inference. However, is there a way to convert existing MHA checkpoints
          into MQA-based ones? Given that the cost of retraining models is quite high,
          it would be nice if there''s a way to convert MHA model weights to MQA ones.
          </p>

          <p>Thanks for helping! And looking forward to your thoughts on this.  </p>
