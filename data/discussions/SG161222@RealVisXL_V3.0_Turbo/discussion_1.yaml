        html: '<p>Hello, I''m a big fan of your model and I plan to use it for my
          master thesis with some adjustments (with you permission of course). I really
          want the model to follow text with more detailed face descriptions (such
          as round face, high cheeks, narrow face etc.) which sadly fail on your model.  For
          further work I plan to use a dataset with such descriptions.  Do you have
          any suggestions as to how would I achieve the best results?</p>

          <ul>

          <li>By fine-tuning your model with detailed description dataset </li>

          <li>or merging  your and a new model fine-tuned on this dataset?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>Any suggestions as to how do you think it''s best to tackle this problem
          is appreciated.  Thank you for everything.</p>
