          <p>This is not currently implemented but you can easily add it on top of
          the model yourself since you can have  access to the samples from the encoder.
          If this is something you think would be interesting to be implemented directly
          in the library, do not hesitate to open an <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/clementchadebec/benchmark_VAE/issues/new/choose">issue</a>
          :)</p>

          <p>I hope this helps.</p>

          <p>PS:  In the future, do not hesitate to open a <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/clementchadebec/benchmark_VAE/discussions/new/choose">discussion</a>
          on the github repo directly so everything is gathered there :)</p>
