  content: 'Yeah that''s what I thought they meant at first, as the original model
    creator also released GGUFs.


    So my original answer stands @PrimeD , there should be no difference between my
    GGUFs and those done by the original model creator.


    I forgot to remove the fp16_hf from the filenames before creating the GGUFs. It
    has no significance, it''s there simply because that''s how the original model
    repo was named and I forgot to take it out of the filename prefixes.'
