          <p>When you say "uncensorship request", do you mean that you''re using some
          kind of jailbreak? This model shouldn''t need one, so if you are you might
          be introducing the idea of censorship yourself, a kind of "don''t think
          of a pink elephant" situation.</p>

          using another prompt format or language, that will be an issue.</p>
