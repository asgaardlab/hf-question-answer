          <p>The biggest difference between v 1, 2 and 3 is the eyes. A huge improvement
          from the first iteration to the 3rd.</p>

          <p>Pruned models are the norm, they output near identical images to a non
          pruned while saving you multiple gb''s per model.</p>

          <p>Hope this has cleared up any questions you had! :)</p>

          <p>Hey, just confirming Dddok''s post. V1 was mostly a proof of concept,
          done through weighted sum merges only, and then pruned. When I got some
          nice feedback on my results, that''s when I posted it here. V2 was redone
          using rebasin merging to achieve equivalent results with a bit of a cleaner
          merging process and an easier time getting it down to a smaller file size.
          Close-up eyes improved significantly at that stage, which was what got me
          to focus on that next. For V3, I redid part of the merge and reduced the
          lora component of the merge. Speaking of, if you want to take a swing at
          that, I''ll link it below. It''s pretty fun on most models, but it definitely
          does have some eye quality issues. Should run well on top of this model
          at &lt;=0.6 weight, and most others &lt;=0.7.</p>
