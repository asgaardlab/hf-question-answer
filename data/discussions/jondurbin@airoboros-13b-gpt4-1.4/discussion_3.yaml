          <p>A really cool team who''s willing to replicate the orca paradigm from

          <p>I''m a big fan of your airoboros gpt4 model, I also believe that only
          gpt4 instruct dataset matter, quality &gt; quantity, and I hope this dataset
          will help you make an even greater version of it</p>
