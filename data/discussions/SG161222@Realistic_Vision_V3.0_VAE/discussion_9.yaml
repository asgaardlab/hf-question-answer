        html: '<p>First thank you for providing such a nice model!<br>I''ve tried
          converting your model from safetensors to <code>diffusers</code>''s format
          using their <code>from_ckpt</code> (before you release this), but I encountered
          something like this: <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/3595">https://github.com/huggingface/diffusers/issues/3595</a></p>

          <p>I still can finish the conversion, but I wonder if that will cause negative
          effect on the output quality, so I''m curious if you encountered similar
          issues?</p>
