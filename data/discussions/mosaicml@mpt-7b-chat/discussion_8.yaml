        html: '<p>Hi, we''re planning for one of our employees to have a presentation
          at the conference. The topic would be "Deciphering the Value and Efficiency
          of Self-Hosted LLMs" and we wanted to use mpt-7b-chat to show an example
          of fine tuning with some custom data. We understand that the model is under
          CC-By-NC-SA-4.0 (non-commercial use only). We strongly believe our goal
          is educational driven, but I wanted to double check if it is ok to use the
          model for such event.</p>

          <p>--<br>Thanks,<br>Adam</p>
