        html: '<p>So when I initially tried to load with llama-cpp-python it nothing
          happened. Model loads, and isn''t None from it not being found, but program
          just quit without an error. Turns out i needed to reinstall llama cpp python
          to get the bindings that work with GGUFv2.  </p>

          <p>It would be helpful in the future to have GGUF version error. I''ll have
          to make a note on github, but I''m writing this here because someone will
          likely hae the same error as me.</p>
