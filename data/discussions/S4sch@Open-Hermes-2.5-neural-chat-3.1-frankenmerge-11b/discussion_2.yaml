          <p>Yes, i could do that. Right now i even a students project in which i
          will present merging, so currently i am designing an .ipynb file which automatizes
          the entire process for merging, quantization and the testing and does all
          the necessary installs. The goal is that at the end, you only would have
          to define the models you want to merge and everything should be done. I
          can tell you as soon as im closer to finishing that.</p>

          <p>That would be awesome, if you literally search for mergekit or merging
          models and everything else on Youtube, Google and etc... You cannot find
          a single tutorial about it, we could have a bunch of more people growing
          the entire ecosystem if these process could be easily tutored or like you''re
          trying to do automated.</p>

        html: '<p>Yeah i feel you, i also realized at the beginning when i came into

          The best forum i would recommend is <a rel="nofollow" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/">https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/</a>.
          There you find atleast some information for some of the things in the open
          source model space. I''m not sure whether there is anything specific about
          how to merge though, but there might be. </p>
