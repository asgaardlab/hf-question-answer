        html: '<p>Thanks for sharing that! Do you find it works well with use names
          even if you remove the system prompt instructions that reference only roleplaying
          as {{char}}? One of the test cases I use is a group chat where use names
          is on by default, and occasionally the model would still want to produce
          text as my character, which I was trying to suppress in the system prompt.
          I also think I''m going to update my recommended sampler settings soon because
          I think the high temp, lower min-p is contributing to some issues.<br>If
          you don''t mind, would you test the model with temp around 1.25, Min-P around
          0.8, and freq pen set to 0 and let me know if you think that''s an improvement?</p>
