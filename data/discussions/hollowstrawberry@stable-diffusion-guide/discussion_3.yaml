        html: '<p>More specifically I started getting an os is not defined error (fixed
          temporarily by placing import os at the start of the code, but upon refreshing
          the page this fixed itself), and it then changed to root_dir is not defined
          error, which also later sorted itself out with no code changes. I''ve looked
          into zipfile is not defined, but am still unsure of why that happens? Also
          how does it grab the url for the drive directory? Do I not have to input
          it anywhere?</p>
