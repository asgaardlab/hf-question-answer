          <p>I don''t why, but Google Colab worked yesterday, yet today when I opened
          the copy and pressed the "play button" again with the same settings, it
          doesn''t generate the public URL, only the local one. I''ve tried multiple
          times, it never loads the public one.</p>

          <p>I don''t know how to fix it at all.<br><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/641a65274182690729c82526/QcBNUg5f462GPHdWQDBCE.png"><img

        html: '<p>Hey, sorry for the wait -</p>

          <p>This happens when Gradio is out of service, in which case you should
          turn on "alternative tunnels". That will generate 3 different links <strong>before</strong>
          stable diffusion loads, which you can use afterwards. At least one of them
          should work at any time.</p>

          <p>Good luck</p>
