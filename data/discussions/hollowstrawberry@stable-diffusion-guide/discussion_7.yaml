        html: '<p>Hey, I''ve read your guide on making LoRAs and it really helped
          me a lot!<br>I wanted to try to make my own character LoRA with this character:</p>

          <p>I want the LoRA to be able to distinguish between the character having
          wings (and the headgear or whatever) and without, so effectively I want
          to train two "outfits".<br>However, when I put the identifier/activation
          tag/trigger, the LoRA starts to learn the wings and the headgear and puts
          them everywhere, even if not specified. I have also tried separating both
          outfits into different folders and giving each dataset a unique tag, but
          the results still show bleedthrough of the wings and headgear.<br>What can
          I do to separate both styles more?</p>

          <p>I really appreciate your help!</p>
