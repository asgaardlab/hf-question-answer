        html: '<p>Oh, yeah, I think I''ve run into that.  Then, of course, there are
          certain phrases and specific response biases that are <em>really</em> ingrained.  I
          mean, so ingrained that I''m kind of at a loss as to how they ended up that
          way in the base model (unless that''s not where they came from).  There
          is simply <em>no way</em> (I would bet a lot of money on it) that some of
          these phrases occur with <em>that</em> much regularity in English prose
          generally.  I don''t have the background to have much of an informed opinion,
          but it seems as if Meta deliberately injected  them (I''m not quite sure
          what the terms/concepts to choose from are) as a way of training out whatever
          they worried would offend Mark Zuckerberg''s apparent delicate sensibilities
          and/or risk bad press--or something.  </p>

          <p>It''s uncanny that you mentioned that (or perhaps we are all a certain
          sort of mutant that all ended up in the same place due to the whims of the
          great magnet), because I got so annoyed with it as of yesterday that I started
          researching  how to create my own corpora.  I have some background in psychology,
          etc., and the other day I suddenly realized what I had to do:  there is
          a <em>massive</em> amount of material available in academic journals (or
          linked through them or elsewhere online to digital collections at university
          libraries) the raw data used by studies in psychology, sociology, etc. I
          found transcripts today of the classic Stanford University prison experiment
          lolol, as well as chat logs. If you are interested in anything like that
          (or anything else, really, I just enjoy hunting for things), let me know.</p>
