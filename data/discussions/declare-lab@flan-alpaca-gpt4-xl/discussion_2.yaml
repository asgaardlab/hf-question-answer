        html: '<p>Hi there,</p>

          <p>Thank you for sharing the model. </p>

          <p>Currently, I am utilizing instruction prompts from the GitHub repository
          located at <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/google-research/FLAN/blob/main/flan/v2/flan_templates_branched.py">https://github.com/google-research/FLAN/blob/main/flan/v2/flan_templates_branched.py</a>
          for my conversational chatbot. </p>

          <p>I am curious if the model has been fine-tuned using specific sets of
          optimized prompt templates or structures. If there are any accompanying
          write-ups or blog posts detailing the process of fine-tuning the model from
          flan-t5-xl, I would greatly appreciate it if you could share them with me.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, I would be grateful if you could provide the optimized prompt
          templates/structures to enhance the text generation capabilities of the
          model, ensuring optimal performance and quality. </p>

          <p>I look forward to hearing from you.</p>

          <p>Best regards.</p>
