          <p>It''s a GUI frontend for the actual AI model. It uses the base SD model
          when you first install it but you can direct it to WD with a little bit
          of work. Just follow all the install instructions. Note that you need a
          good GPU with a lot of VRAM. I''ve heard people pulling it off with 6gb
          but 8gb is preferable. </p>

          <p>Once you install that you can edit the diffusionserver.py file to redirect
          the program to use this repo. It should be line 28, replace         "CompVis/stable-diffusion-v1-4"
          with "hakurei/waifu-diffusion". </p>

          <p>Or you can make a variable model_id = "hakurei/waifu-diffusion" and then
          make the program use model_id, if you have multiple models you want to use.
          Swapping between model_id#s is easier than pasting the directory for new
          models each time imo.</p>
