        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>Can you please explain how i should load the ckpt models? My first error
          was that ''revision fp16 does not exist''. Next it started to download all
          the ckpt epochs and I  don''t have that much space! E.g. should I download
          all the epochs or only the last epoch? How do I load fp16 now that revision
          arg is not working? EDIT: After downloading all the ckpt files the loading
          errored with ''config.json'' could not be found.<br>Thanks!</p>
