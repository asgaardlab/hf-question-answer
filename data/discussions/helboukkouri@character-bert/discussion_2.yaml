        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>Recently, I found a repository with CharacterBert and realized that this
          model would be perfect for one of the projects, on which I am currently
          working. However, while trying to figure out how to use this model I encountered
          an error:</p>

          <p>tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("helboukkouri/character-bert",
          trust_remote_code=True)</p>

          <blockquote>

          <blockquote>

          </blockquote>

          <p>NotImplementedError: CharacterBERT does not have a token vocabulary.</p>

          </blockquote>

          <p>I tried to download files from "Files and version" and tinker with <strong>tokenization_character_bert.py</strong>
          and successfully loaded the tokenizer. However, I still cannot figure out
          how to pass output from the tokenizer to the model. More precisely I can''t
          return outputs from the tokenizer as pytorch tensors, because they have
          mismatched length (due to special symbols). Do you have any idea how to
          use this model within the HuggingFace framework? </p>
