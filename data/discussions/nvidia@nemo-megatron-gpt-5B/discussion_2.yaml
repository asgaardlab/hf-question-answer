        html: '<p>Hi,<br>I am a data engineer and I just getting into AI models. I
          am interested in building something with my confluence page information
          for our internal chatbot for work. The use case is instead of searching
          the whole confluence for some details, it should answer like chatGPT.</p>

          <p>Here are my questions:</p>

          <p>Can I do this this model or is there any other recommended models?</p>

          <p>What are the steps to fine-tune? Could someone point out if there is
          any existing codebase to do that?<br>Appreciate any help in this.<br>Thanks,<br>Shinji</p>
