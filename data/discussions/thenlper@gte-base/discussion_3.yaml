        html: '<p>Is it expected? Or did I miss something?</p>

          <p>The log is following:</p>

          <pre><code>Some weights of BertForSequenceClassification were not initialized
          from the model checkpoint at /tmp/thenlper_gte-base and are newly initialized:
          [''classifier.bias'', ''classifier.weight'']

          You should probably TRAIN this model on a down-stream task to be able to
          use it for predictions and inference.
