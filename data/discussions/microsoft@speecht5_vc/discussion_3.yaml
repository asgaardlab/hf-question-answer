        html: '<p>Hi there, first let me thank you for this model and the great demo/blogpost!</p>

          <p>When I use the model with my own .wav files as the input, the output
          .wav lose a lot of words / information.  You mention this in the blogpost,
          but I''m finding that this is very frequent, enough that it makes the model
          unusable for my purposes.</p>

          <p>I''ve observed other VC models (this one, which is more specific to singing)
          that don''t seem to have this problem.  Is this something inherent to the
          model, or the training set?</p>
