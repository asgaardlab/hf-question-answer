    If you are interested, I have some ideas, scripts, and the beginnings of some
    datasets I''ve made from scratch to give broader knowledge to LLMs on several
    subjects that it seems every coding model is weak on.  There are several things
    I am building datasets around, such as,  more current knowledge on code for LM
    development, training efficiency improvements, and groundbreaking projects that
    add new technologies.  I am also focusing on stretching coding context with larger
    scripting examples, rather than small and narrow scripting examples that are common
    in most datasets.


    I only have CPU rigs with large ram to train with, and it''s too slow to be practical
    so, I''ve been looking for someone with access to GPU rigs.  If you''d like to
    collaborate, let me know.'
