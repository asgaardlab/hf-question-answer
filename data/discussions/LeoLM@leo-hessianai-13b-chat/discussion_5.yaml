        html: '<p>In general, it is not recommended to finetuned from an already instruction-tuned
          model. Try using our base model <code>LeoLM/leo-hessianai-13b</code> instead.
          Also the quality of your domain specific instruction data is super important.
          Make sure to cover a wide range of tasks and difficulties. Perhaps consider
          including some of the datasets we used during the training for better alignment.
          Hope this helps :)</p>
