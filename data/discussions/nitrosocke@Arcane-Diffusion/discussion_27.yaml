        html: '<p>The League of Legends spin-off Legends of Runeterra has a lot of
          great art for the cards (all widescreen except for spells unfortunately)
          and have the same general style, but with some more variety in content.
          Like boats and dragons and bears, fantasy and steampunk and pirates, etc.</p>

          <p>I think this would add a lot to the model if included in the dataset
          for future training, if any is planned.</p>
