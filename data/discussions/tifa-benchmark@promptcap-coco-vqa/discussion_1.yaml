        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I have tried this model using a few sample images and I was wondering
          if giving OCR inputs to the model makes it better than the standard VQA
          one.<br>In other words, does giving OCR inputs improve the accuracy of the
          model?</p>

          <p>Thanks</p>
