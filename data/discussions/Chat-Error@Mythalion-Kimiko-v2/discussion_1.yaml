        html: '<p>nRuaif, is this what I think it is, what it appears to be? </p>

          <p>A version of Mythalion with Kimiko, capable of 8K context!?</p>

          <p>I don''t know why nobody has noticed or talked about this model until
          now? It''s like you quietly slipped it out there with no fanfare or notice
          and nobody noticed it existed? I''m sure you know Kimiko is considered an
          important enhancement to MythoMax, so much so that most people promote ''MythoMax
          Kimiko v2'' over the original.  Mythalion was also considerd an improvement
          over MythoMax.  Yet here it seems we have BOTH improvements in the same
          package, and there''s an 8K context version out there!?</p>

          <p>I''m amazed nobody''s tested, reviewed or discussed this model yet. I''m
          eager to experiment and see what it can do.  An 8K context version of MythoMax
          is like an answer to my prayers. </p>

          <p>Out of curiousity, did you spend much time playing with this model yourself?
          What are your own thoughts on it? How does it compare versus MythoMax Kimiko
          and Mythalion? Maybe you''re just humble, but if I were in your shoes, I''d
          have wanted a lot more people to be aware this model existed.  Some of the
          key limitations of MythoMax are resolvable with Pygmalion, Kimiko and an
          8K context buffer so I''m eager to see what this model can do.  I''d love
          to hear your thoughts, and also why you didn''t tell anyone about it!? lol</p>

          <p>Also: I''m not sure if Kimiko is what has enabled MythoMax to work in
          8K or if it was always capable of that, or even if you''re aware there is
          an 8K version, but I noticed an 8K GGUF at the following address:</p>

          <p><a href="https://huggingface.co/actionpace/Mythalion-Kimiko-v2">https://huggingface.co/actionpace/Mythalion-Kimiko-v2</a></p>

          <p>I''ve started to test it out, and so far, I''m very happy with my new
          and enhanced 8K version of MythoMax, with Pygmalion and Kimiko :D</p>
