        html: '<p>You may have seen me posting sample images that include Santa in
          models like this one and Kitsch-In-Sync. It''s not because of the season,
          overtrained models struggle with Santa, and it''s not just that, they''ve
          been so overtrained that they have forgotten Santa and many other things
          that can''t be drawn at all, they will be ignored from your prompt along
          with artists styles and stuff, as an example, here''s Meina7 with the same
          prompt:</p>

          forgotten about?</p>
