        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Thank you very much for releasing the weights for stable diffusion v1.4.
          I think it is an excellent addition to the TensorFlow/Keras community.<br>I
          was searching for the TensorFlow weights or code compatible with the stable
          diffusion v2, but couldn''t find any.<br>Do you, by any chance, happen to
          have the weights for this new SD version? It would be a great contribution
          for the community to play with!</p>

          <p>Cheers.</p>
