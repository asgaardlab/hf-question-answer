          \ The one you chose -the BigScience BLOOM RAIL 1.0- was specifically drafted\
          \ for the BLOOM set of models, and your model is based on Stable Diffusion,\
          \ not BLOOM. It would be also cool if you could include the license in your\
          \ Spaces for this model! (in case you have some).</p>\n<p>Thanks in advance\
