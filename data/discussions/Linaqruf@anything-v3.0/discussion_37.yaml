        html: '<p>Hello, although I know that this medium is usually used to discuss,
          I would like to use it to ask you about an error that I have had to put
          up with for a few days. It turns out that when trying to create a model
          with anything v3.0 or V3-1 I get an error that says "unexpected keyword
          argument ''scale'' " I have no idea what it means, Google translation (with
          which I am writing this) tells me that it is an error related to the inclusion
          of the words "scale" as an argument. however I do not understand what this
          refers to because I did not use the word for any model. I hope someone can
          explain the problem to me and I hope they excuse me for the inappropriate
          use of this discussion space... thanks ^^</p>
