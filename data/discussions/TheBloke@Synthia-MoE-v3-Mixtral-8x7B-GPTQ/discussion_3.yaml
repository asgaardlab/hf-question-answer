        html: '<p>I ran this successfully on a home PC with a GeForce 4090 RTX. It
          ran on oobabooga. I couldn''t build auto-gptq from source, but the transformers
          update worked. I had to select AutoGPTQ from oobabooga too.</p>

          <p>It thinks for a long time before answering. At 0.5 temp, it is giving
          coherent and thoughtful answers to complex questions. This feels like I
          am running something between GPT-3.5 Turbo and GPT-4 Turbo (like Claude)
          on my PC. I am shocked at the progress being made with these. This is the
          best model yet. I wonder how much impact Synthia made. These mixtral models
          are clearly the next gen.</p>
