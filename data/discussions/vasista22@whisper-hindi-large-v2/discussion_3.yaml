          <p>This being an Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR) model, passing Hindi
          audio as input would give the transcription in Hindi.<br>Since this model
          has been fine-tuned for 57000 steps on about 3500 hours of data which is
          quite substantial, the model must have been biased completely towards generating
          Hindi tokens (which in a way is desired in this ASR fine-tuning) and is
          therefore not doing well on the translation task.</p>

          <p>To obtain the English translation of a Hindi audio, you may try the 3
          methods listed below:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Set decoder_prompt_ids to (language="hi", task="translate") and use
          the openai''s original whisper model. The accuracy is quite low though,
          from Hindi-&gt;English.</li>

          <li>Using a speech translation model. There are not many good options though
          for Indian languages.</li>

          <li>Using a cascade system. Example, get the Hindi output from a good ASR
          model (you could continue using this whisper-hindi-large-v2 for this). Pass
          the output of this to a machine translation model. The nllb from Facebook
          (<a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M">https://huggingface.co/facebook/nllb-200-distilled-600M</a>)
          is good enough from Hindi to English (has a 20-30% error). This according
          to me is a better option to get the English translation for a Hindi audio.</li>

          </ol>
