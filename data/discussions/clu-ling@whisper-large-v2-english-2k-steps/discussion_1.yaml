          <p>Thank you for your improved models, is it possible to make the same upgrades
          to the newly released whisper large-v3 model? If it''s not. Could you release
          your steps to reproduce the results and i will try to do it myself.</p>

          <p>Thank you for contacting us. I tried to attach the files I used to fine-tune
          large-v2 here, but I could not due to restrictions on specific files. So,  I

          <p>Thank you, if i may bother you a bit could you go little bit in details
          on your data? like is it regular audio files with subs or it''s something
          else? if you could expand on the commands you used that would be really
          helpful. I found your model to be rather big improvements to regular whisper-v2
          at least for Japanese.</p>

          <p>Thank you again.</p>

          <p>P.S: if the reason you aren''t upload to upload the data is due to size
          or something else, we you can contact me and i can provide private hosting
