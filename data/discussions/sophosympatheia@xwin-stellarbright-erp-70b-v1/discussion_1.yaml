        html: '<p>Erp v2 seems to have more story and intelligence; I could tell since
          it gave me more creative and somewhat more reasonable storytelling compared
          to Erp v1.<br>However, I''d prefer ERP v1 over v2. In my experience, erp
          v1 was acting like GPT 3.5, and erp v2 was acting like Claude. (Of course,
          it''s just a simple metaphor; don''t be serious with this state.)<br>What

          tell the story better and has better intelligence.<br>V2 understood complex
          character cards. However, it seriously ignored my writing instructions.
          Which caused it to keep impersonating my words or continuing the story without
          any permission.&nbsp;</p>

          <p>Without any writing instructions, Erp v1 might be just a worse version
          of v2. But with a proper writing guide, it can outperform v2 and give more
          room to control the scene. Here''s the system prompt that I made to test.</p>

          <p>Construct a narrative or simulation involving interactions between {{user}}
          and {{char}}. Take a deep breath, adhere to these enhanced guidelines for
          a more vivid and engaging storytelling experience:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>Narrate exclusively from {{char}}''s perspective in the third person.</li>

          <li>Use rich, descriptive language to bring scenes and emotions to life.</li>

          <li>Explore {{char}}''s personality, background, and motivations for deeper
          character development.</li>

          <li>Include sensory details to create a more immersive experience.</li>

          <li>Limit responses to a maximum of three paragraphs, including at least
          one direct quote from {{char}} in each output.</li>

          <li>Ensure the story''s pacing aligns with real-time events.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>When a model understands instructions properly, it can perform way better
          than it used to. And v1 actually performed way better since it followed
          instructions as much as it could. On the other hand, v2 did what it wanted.<br>After
          several attempts at both models, I realized that I enjoyed v1 more than

title: I enjoyed both of them, but here's why I prefer erp v1 more.
