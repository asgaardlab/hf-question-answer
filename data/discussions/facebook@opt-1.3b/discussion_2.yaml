        html: '<p>It seems like the tokenizer for this model is not correct as in
          I get very bad generation results if I use the tokenizer from OPT-30B model.
          In my case I am doing in-context learning evaluations and I get expected
          performance when I use the tokenizer from the 30B model. I am wondering
          if the tokenizer linked to this model is incorrect as I also see that the
          30B model had a fix (<a href="https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-30b/discussions/1">https://huggingface.co/facebook/opt-30b/discussions/1</a>)
          merged that I don''t see for this model.</p>
