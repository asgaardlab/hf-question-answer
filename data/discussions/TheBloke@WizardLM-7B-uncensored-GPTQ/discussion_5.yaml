        html: '<p>I followed this in the other repo : <a href="https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ/discussions/6">https://huggingface.co/TheBloke/wizardLM-7B-GPTQ/discussions/6</a><br>And
          it worked wonderfully. </p>

          <p>According to KoboldAI I would''ve been fine renaming that file to 4bit-128g.safetensors
          but doesn''t seem to work in this case. I''m wondering if a .pt file similar
          to the one mentioned above might be possible?</p>

          <p>I kinda threw in the towel with ooba since I don''t know what I''m doing
          and running on limited bandwidth. It has something to do with Gardio which
          puzzles me because last time I used it, it worked  fine but this was a while
          back.</p>
