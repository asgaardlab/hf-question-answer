          I would like though to understand what means "GPL" for an AI model.

          It is possible to use a GPL software product for a commercial organization
          provided that it does not resell a product derived from this software.

          If an business would use a server running the snoozy model "as a service"
          (accessible through a set of custom APIs) as it is, would this be considered
          as an infringement of the GPL license ?

          If not can we thus consider that Snoozy, under certain conditions, is available
          for commercial use.


          Thanks very much for your answer.'

          be a problem (The Linux kernel is, after all, GPL2 and is used in many commercial
          products).  A lot also depends on what constitutes a "derivative work" under
          GPL.  For example, using the model directly from the HuggingFace repo wouldn''t
          create a derivative work.  Tuning and creating a LoRA?  Maybe it is derivative,
          or maybe not -- it''s a separate file that''s applied after loading the
          GPL''ed model.  But the new model created via PEFT is arguably a derived
          work.</p>

          <p>Whether creating a pipeline, e.g., LangChain, creates a derivative work,
          is questionable, as it''s not a model based on the original that''s been
          trained or fine-tuned through any back-and-forth between the model and new
          front end; it''s simply a pipe between two or more distinct pieces that
          interact through a well-defined API.  I don''t think you can call a program
          that queries a GPL''ed database via SQL or some custom search language derivative.</p>

          <p>Now the model card says this model is derived from Llama, which has a
          Creative Commons Non Commercial license, which means it can''t be used for
          commercial purposes, GPL not withstanding.  In fact, iI have no idea whether
