        html: '<p>I am able to run this model as well as lighter models, but in about
          2-4 promts given to the model (in the process of answering) it fails with
          "Process finished with exit code 139 (interrupted by signal 11: SIGSEGV)".
          The same behavior for all gpt4all models downloaded 2-3 days ago. I am running
          it on Macbook Pro M1 (2021), 16 GB RAM. Tried python from 3.9 to 3.11. Also,
          tried with Jupyter lab (kernel 3.10), PyCharm and terminal. It is all the
          same. Any ideas where the problem may come from?</p>
