          <p>I am a huge fan of yours. Quick question: what dataset did you use to
          finetune this SFT model?</p>

          <p>You said:</p>

          <p>OpenHermes was trained on 1,000,000 entries of primarily GPT-4 generated
          data, as well as other high quality data from open datasets across the AI
          landscape.  **** [More details soon] ****</p>

          <p>Is it possible to tell other open source dataset (if the 1M entries of
          GPT-4 is not available to us). Thanks!</p>
