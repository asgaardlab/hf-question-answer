        html: '<p>Hi, and thanks a lot for sharing this!</p>

          <p>The license tag says "mit", which is also the license of the GitHub repo.</p>

          <p>However, this (Hugging Face) repo does not contain a file for the license.</p>

          <p>There are at least two versions of the MIT license (with the same SPDIX
          identifier), and obviously the copyright notice to preserve is absent.</p>

          <p>I imagine the text of the license would probably be the same as that
          of the GitHub repo, but it''d be better not to have to assume.</p>

          <p>Would you consider adding a LICENSE file for this (Hugging Face) repo
          too?</p>
