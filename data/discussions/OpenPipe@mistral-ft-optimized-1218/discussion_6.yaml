          <p>UPDATE: yes, it appears that of the 5 base models included in this merge,
          one of them (Starling) has a cc-by-nc license, which means this model should
          have a cc-by-nc license as well. I''ll update the license now and work on
          identifying a new set of base models that give similar performance without
          the nc restrictions.</p>
