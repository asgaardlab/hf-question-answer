        html: '<p>Thanks for sharing how to load face id''s lora file, I was using
          the same method to load ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15_lora and the images
          generated were terrible. The code to load is as follows:<br>ip_ckpt = "ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15.bin"<br>lora_ckpt
          = "ip-adapter-faceid-plus_sd15_lora.safetensors"<br>...<br>pipe.load_lora_weights(lora_ckpt)<br>pipe.fuse_lora()<br>ip_model
          = IPAdapterFaceIDPlus(pipe, image_encoder_path, ip_ckpt, device)</p>

          <p>Is there any problem with the above code please? Or the same method doesn''t
          work with the plus lora?</p>
