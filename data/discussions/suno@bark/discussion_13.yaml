        html: '<p>bark work with .npz, which is a compiled file of 3 .npy inside,
          one for each model bark uses to work: coarse.pt, fine.pt and text.pt, for
          sure you can train these models, but npz is made by sequentially prompts
          and some rules should be followed to avoid hallucinations, a member of community
          said some reasons of hallucinations:<br>It''s hallucination related in two
          ways.<br>1.) Some voices, especially cloned voices, might be unstable and
          hallucinate generally.<br>2.) If the language in the text prompt is very
          different than the language in the voice (Chinese/English, but even English-Slang/English-Fancy-Victorian-Novel.
          Oh and<br>3.) If the text prompt is the same as the text prompt ''inside''
          the voice, it hallucinates. So if you make a new voice, then use voice to
          speak exact like that created voice. (Edge case but worth mentioning.)<br>4.)
          Way too long text prompt. Just try packing the text prompt as full as you
          can, almost always hallucinates. Once in awhile it just reads beginning.<br>5.)
          Too short prompt (less than 5 words) make it somewhat more likely.<br>6.)
          Uses of [tags] can increase chances.</p>
