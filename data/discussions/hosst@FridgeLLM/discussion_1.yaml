          <p>Document Title: Fridges Pretrained Model Documentation (Draft)<br>Author:
          Jose Gutierrez (DNActions)<br>Date: 2023-05-22</p>

          <p>Model Description: The Fridges pretrained model is a Transformer-based
          model with 12 layers and 1024 neurons per layer.<br>The model is trained
          using the Adam optimizer with a learning rate of 0.0001.</p>

          <p>Hyperparameters:<br>Learning rate: 0.0001<br>Batch size: 32<br>Number
          of epochs: 10<br>Performance: The model is evaluated on a dataset of 10000
          text descriptions of fridges. The model achieves an accuracy of 95%.</p>

          <p>Usage:</p>

          <p>The model can be used to answer questions about fridges. For example,
          the model can be used to answer questions such as:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>What are the different types of fridges?</li>

          <li>What are the features/tech specs of a fridge?</li>

          <li>How do I use a (certain) fridge feature?</li>

          </ul>

          <p>The model can also be used to generate text about fridges. For example,
          the model can be used to generate text such as:</p>

          <ul>

          <li>A fridge is a kitchen appliance that is used to store food and drinks.</li>

          <li>Ways to store food on a fridge/freezer.</li>

          <li>Fridges come in a variety of sizes, models and styles.</li>

          <li>Fridges typically have a freezer compartment and a refrigerator compartment.</li>

          </ul>

          <p>The model can be used in a variety of applications, such as:</p>

          <p>Customer support: The model can be used to answer customer questions
          about fridges.</p>

          <p>Product development: The model can be used to help develop new features
          for fridges.</p>

          <p>Manufacturers: The model can be used to analyze features usage and troubleshooting
          issues.</p>

          <p>Marketing: The model can be used to generate marketing content about
          fridges.</p>

          <p>Usage Cases:</p>

          <p>The model can be used by technicians, manufacturers, and retailers.</p>

          <p>Technicians:<br>The model can be used to help technicians diagnose and
          repair fridges. For example, the model can be used to identify potential
          problems with the fridge''s components or to generate instructions for troubleshooting.<br>The
          model can also be used to improve the technician''s customer service. For
          example, the model can be used to answer customer questions about fridge
          repairs or to provide estimates for repairs.<br>The model can be used to
          update technicians about new tech components, or to teach people who want
          to become fridge technicians. </p>

          <p>Manufacturers:<br>The model can be used to help manufacturers design
          new fridges. For example, the model can be used to generate ideas for new
          features or to identify potential problems with existing designs. I can
          help to increas/reduce spending on certain features for specific fridge
          price levels.<br>The manufacturer can also use the model to improve the
          quality of its customer support. For example, the model can be used to answer
          customer questions about fridges or to provide troubleshooting advice.</p>

          <p>Retailers:<br>The model can be used to help retailers help customers
          choose the right fridge for their needs. For example, the model can be used
          to generate recommendations based on the customer''s budget, lifestyle,
          and preferences.<br>The retailer can also use the model to improve its marketing
          campaigns. For example, the model can be used to generate personalized ads
          or to create content that is relevant to the customer''s interests.</p>

          <p>License: The model is available under the Apache 2.0 license.</p>
