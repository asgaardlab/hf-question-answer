        html: '<p>[INST]<br>What is the meaning of life?<br>[/INST]<br>The meaning
          of life is a question that has puzzled philosophers and theologians for
          centuries. While there is no one definitive answer, here are some possible
          meanings:</p>

          <ol>

          <li>Purpose or significance: The meaning of life can be found in having
          purpose or significance, whether it''s through work, relationships, creative
          pursuits, or personal growth.</li>

          <li>Happiness or fulfillment: Some people believe that the meaning of life
          is to seek happiness and fulfillment, either through material possessions,
          experiences, or inner peace.</li>

          <li>Connection or community: For others, the meaning of life may lie in
          building strong connections with others, whether through family, friends,
          or community involvement.</li>

          <li>Personal growth and development: Some people find meaning in personal
          growth and self-improvement, whether through learning new skills, exploring
          their interests, or overcoming challenges.</li>

          <li>Legacy or impact: Others see the meaning of life as leaving a lasting
          legacy or making a positive impact on society or future generations.</li>

          <li>Spirituality or faith: Many people find meaning in spirituality or religion,
          whether through belief in a higher power, moral principles, or a sense of
          connection to something greater than oneself.</li>

          <li>Fulfilling values: Meaning can also be found by living according to
          one''s own values and priorities, such as honesty, kindness, or compassion.</li>

          <li>Adventure or challenge: Some people find meaning in seeking out new
          adventures and challenges, whether through travel, sports, artistic expression,
          or other forms of self-expression.</li>

          <li>Love and relationships: For many, the meaning of life lies in cultivating
          deep and meaningful relationships with others, whether romantic, familial,
          or platonic.</li>

          <li>Contribution or service: Still others find meaning in contributing to
          society or helping others, whether through charitable work, volunteering,
          or public service.<br>Ultimately, the meaning of life is highly individual
          and subjective, and what brings meaning and satisfaction to one person may
          not do so for another. It''s important to reflect on what matters most to
          you and to live accordingly.</li>

          <ol>

          <li>Purpose or significance: Martin Luther King Jr., a civil rights leader,
          found his purpose in fighting for racial equality and social justice. He
          believed that his actions had a profound impact on history and left a lasting
          legacy.</li>

          <li>Happiness or fulfillment: Aristotle, a Greek philosopher, believed that
          the ultimate goal of human existence was eudaimonia (happiness) and that
          this could only be achieved through virtuous living. His philosophy focused
          on achieving balance between physical, emotional, intellectual, and ethical
          well-being.</li>

          <li>Connection or community: Mother Teresa, a Catholic nun and missionary,
          devoted her life to serving the poor and marginalized. She built strong
          bonds with those she helped and became known as "the angel of Calcutta"
          due to her selfless care and love.</li>

          <li>Personal growth and development: Nelson Mandela, a South African anti-apartheid
          revolutionary and politician, spent 27 years imprisoned but still managed
          to grow and develop personally. During his time behind bars, he read voraciously
          and mentally prepared himself for leadership once released. Upon release,</li>
