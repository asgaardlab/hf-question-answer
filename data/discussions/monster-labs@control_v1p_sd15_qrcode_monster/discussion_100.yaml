          (For me it was more like v9 and v37 out of ~50 versions)

          What I do remember is that v1 vs v2 is: More data, and a lot of fiddling
          around, some patterns work differently with different hyperparameters etc...

          Once I get around doing the post, we can discuss all of that in more detail
          if need be.'

    \ what are the differences between your way and @achiru 's (we'll wait for his\
    \ hopefully-soon-to-be-published post).\nOne question though: Did you simply convert\
    \ the images to black and white using HSV method (+guassian blur and \"remapping\
    \ colors to 33% white-gray-black\" [which, as a side question, honestly I don't\
    \ know what this one means])? \nI'm asking because below you wrote \"My idea was\
    \ to imagine existing images as having been generated by a white-gray-black pattern\
    \ image.\" and I'm not 100% sure I understand what you meant - did you mean that\
    \ you wanted the result of the black-and-whitening and blur to result in an image\
    \ of a simple pattern (\"what you imagined\") and the actual thing you used, that\
    \ apparently did work well, was the slight-blur?"
