          <p>The grey background (#808080) you mentioned in the model card. Is that
          meant as a replacement for the non-module palette color (normally white)
          for the QR that is fed into the controlnet input, or is that a color to
          use for any area outside the square bounds of the entire code?</p>

          <p>Since the training process does not have much info, the current description
          leaves some ambiguity. I do know from small tests that if I make a dual
          color QR with #000000 and #808080  in a simple setup without using a qr
          img to img starting point, it won''t be scannable even when cranking up
          the controlnet strength to 10. But it works fine with the #FFFFFFF non module
          color.</p>

          <p>Was my initial interpretation completely wrong (and the input should
          consist of white+black and grey on the outside) or was it a recommendation
          to enhance greater QR contrast flexibility (with the assumption that img2img
          will also be used)?</p>
