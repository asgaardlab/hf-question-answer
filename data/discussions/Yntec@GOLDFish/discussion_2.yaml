          \ in a VAE, in a way where the model is able to produce those sharp and\
          \ colorful results without one, and then REMOVED it, to save space, because,\
          \ the models draws as if it had it, you don't need a VAE at all. But then\

          \ can't make diffusers out of it. The other 3 are my attempts to fix it,\
          \ I mean, they're all fixed versions that can be used for diffusers. But\
          \ they don't draw the same thing! Extra girls appear on the picture in different\
          \ styles. BlessedVAE is the bottom right and it loses the thread and makes\
          \ something completely different! \U0001F604 But ColorVAE makes that composition\
          \ too, so it looks it was based on Blessed2.</p>\n<p>I'll continue researching\
          \ this, hope one can day I can fix it while retaining the generated content.\
