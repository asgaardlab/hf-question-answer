        html: '<p>It not only goes on an on sometimes, but often repeats in endless
          loops.</p>

          <p>For example, after finishing a response it will often start providing
          a source, which is always wrong by the way, so any url generation directives
          should be removed from the training data. Anyways, then it might add a warning
          about respecting anything remotely related to the top, such as minorities,
          women, celebrities..., then adds a few emojis, then ask if there is anything
          else, then repeat endlessly.</p>

          <p>You need to filter out far more gratuitously additions like moralizing,
          url references, asking if there''s anything else you want, adding emojis...
          otherwise the end token is never given priority. The alignment tax on this
          one is making it unusable.</p>

          <p>In short, the most important things are respecting the users wishes,
          brevity and courtesy, and only in  rare occassions (such as when asking
          how to make meth or steal a car) saying no. If something isn''t remotely
          illegal or amoral (e.g. celebrity gossip) then stay out of it. No adult
          in real life lectures another adult like this. This isn''t human alignment.
          This is brainless and unnatural AI moralizing. I don''t care at all about
          celebrities. They''re just test questions of mine because they test for
          things like this. And this LLM failed miserably. Don''t use AI alignment
          to needless lecture users. </p>
