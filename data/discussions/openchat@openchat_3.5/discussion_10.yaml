        html: '<p>Hello OpenChat Team,</p>

          <p>I hope this message finds you well. I am reaching out to express my appreciation
          for the OpenChat 3.5 model and to discuss a suggestion that could potentially
          extend its reach and usability.</p>

          <p>One of the challenges I have encountered is the limitation posed by hardware
          requirements, which can be a barrier for individuals or researchers with
          access to only lower-end computers. To address this, I am interested in
          exploring the possibility of model sharding for OpenChat 3.5.</p>

          <p>Sharding the model could democratize access, allowing users with less
          powerful hardware to experiment with and benefit from the model''s capabilities.
          This approach could also optimize the use of the model on popular cloud
          platforms like Google Colab and Kaggle, which are essential tools for many
          in the AI community.</p>

          <p>The technical intricacies of model sharding notwithstanding, its implementation
          could lead to broader adoption and spur innovation by enabling a wider audience
          to work with OpenChat 3.5.</p>

          <p>I would love to hear your thoughts on this proposal or any alternative
          solutions that could help mitigate the hardware constraints faced by many
          users.</p>

          <p>Thank you for your contributions to the field and for considering this
          enhancement.</p>
