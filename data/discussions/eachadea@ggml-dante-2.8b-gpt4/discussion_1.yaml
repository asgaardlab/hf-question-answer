          a description? Also, I''ve been contributing to a repo that has Rust bindings

          this file - the file type in the hyperparameters is f32, and the vocabulary
          scoring doesn''t seem to line up with the GGML/GGMF/GGJT format. Is this
          intentional? Do you have any plans to replace this file with one that is
