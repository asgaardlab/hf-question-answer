        html: '<p>How about adding conditioning dropout (let''s say 10%) in training
          just like original stable diffusion?</p>

          <p>Thank you Justin and lambdalabs for sharing the model. It''s really awesome.<br>Would
          it be better for conditioning dropout? Or there is no significant difference
          for fine-tuning.<br>I would appreciate if you could share your take on it.
