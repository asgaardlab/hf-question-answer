        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>Awesome work on this and your other recent models, they are my go to
          models for almost everything at the moment.</p>

          <p>I can''t wait for dolphin 3.0, specially the agent and function calling
          features. But I''d like to ask if it would also be possible to include FIM
          (fill in the middle) feature?</p>

          <p>FIM would be fenomenal for coding, where you can give the full context
          of a file and just generate code for a specific position of said file.</p>

          <p>Stable code from stabilityai includes this feature as well, here''s a
          section about their training data: <a href="https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-3b#training-dataset">https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stable-code-3b#training-dataset</a>.</p>
