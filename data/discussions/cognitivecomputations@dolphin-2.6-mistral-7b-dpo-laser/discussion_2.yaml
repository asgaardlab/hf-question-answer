        html: '<p>Thanks a lot for sharing the model :)<br>I''ve tested the gguf version
          by<br>kroonen/dolphin-2.6-mistral-7b-dpo-laser-GGUF.<br>It performs almost
          better on cpu (in terms of speed) than the LMCocktail-phi-2 version I''m
          testing right now, which has only 3b parameters.</p>

          <p>I''m also very satisfied with the responses so far.</p>

          <p>Would it be possible to share how to build these laser versions?<br>I
          would really like to see this on the current top performers on the llm leaderboard
          with 10b parameters, I bet you could speed them up to the speed of 7b models.
          And 3b models like phi-2 could be blazingly fast on any device.</p>

          <p>Excited to see more of this ^^</p>

          <p>Thanks again</p>
