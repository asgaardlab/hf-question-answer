        html: '<p>Hello,</p>

          <p>I''ve recently come up with the Fashionclip. It''s a fascinating model,
          good job!<br>I tested this model in my dataset. My issue is that because
          Fashionclip is trained on clip-base, it has lower memory than clip-large,
          so it works less efficiently on memory-based queries (e.x. "real Madrid
          t-shirts"). I wonder if you have any repo you trained Fashionclip based
          on clip-large? I guess this would solve the problem.</p>

          <p>Thanks </p>
