        html: '<p>Hello!</p>

          <p>So to clarify, you have a multivariate forecasting problem where the
          size of the multivariate dimension is 5, and you have a 200 time points
          in training.  Since you want to predict 50 time points into the future,
          and there isn''t much data, you might as well set the context length to
          be something small, e.g. 25, and the prediction length to be 50 of course.</p>

          <p>The lag sequence is an array of indices from which one makes the target
          lag features, namely for example if lags_seq = [1, 2, 5] then for each time
          point in the training data we will contact to the target (5 dim array in
          your case) the value of the target 1 step back, 2 steps back and 5 steps
          back... meaning, in the end, you will end up with a vector of size 5 + len(lags_seq)*5
          </p>

          <p>In the end, this array also gets concated by the time features, and thus
          you end up with a final input vector to the transformer. </p>

          <p>The issue is that the number of heads of the transformer has to be divisible
          by the size of this final input vector. It is not in your case, so perhaps
          first try to set the number of heads to 1 in your code to get it working.</p>

          <p>I have not documented how to do multivariate forecasting but it is essentially
          the input_size arg as you have it which will learn a diagonal student-t
          distribution.</p>

          <p> I was thinking of removing the need for the vector size to be divisible
          by the number of heads by adding an initial projection layer... have to
          think about it a bit but perhaps that is a better API... what do you think?</p>

          <p>Thanks again!</p>

    but for some reason I haven''t worked it out.


    Do you have a specific recommendation for what exactly I should have my lags_sequence
    be, in the case where my input is 200 x 5, my target is 50 x 5, and my context_length
    is, let''s say, 25?


    Regarding the divisibility by nheads: I definitely think having a projection layer
    could make the model be more easily usable - I think it''s desired to use the
    model with all possible input sequence lengths x nheads combinations. That being
    said, as I''m still not 100% regarding the translation from the size config arguments
    to the Transformer''s input sequence size, it may be the case that it should be
    the programmer''s responsibility. Maybe after I understand how to use each config
    argument input I''ll have a different opinion :)


    Thank you!
