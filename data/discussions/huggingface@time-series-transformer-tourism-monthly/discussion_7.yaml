        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I was wondering if it''s possible to use this model to make predictions
          for a "gap" in the data, i.e., feeding the values before and after and predicting
          the missing interval? I suppose that maybe the observed mask can play a
          role to achieve this, but I am not entirely certain if it''s possible.</p>

          <p>Thanks,<br>Gil</p>

title: Question regarding observed mask and predicting a "gap" in the data
