        html: '<p>Hi jinyuan22,<br>In the paper, we use the mean embedding over all
          the tokens embedding, CLS excluded, as feature extraction for downstream
          tasks. You can use the CLS token embedding instead and you will probably
          obtain good performance too but you might not find the exact same results
          than in the paper if you use this approach.<br>Hope this helps!</p>
