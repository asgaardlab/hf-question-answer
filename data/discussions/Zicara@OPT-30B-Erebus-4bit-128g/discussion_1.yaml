        html: '<p>Pardon me, I''m new to this.</p>

          <p>The pytorch_model.bin.index.json seems to reference the separate pickled
          files from the original OPT-30B-Erebus, and when I edit it to point to the
          .pt file (which appears to be misnamed?) it still doesn''t work.</p>

          <p>Help?</p>
