        html: '<p>Hi, I''m new to Stable diffusion. Please forgive my stupid question,
          I wonder what is the "respective LoRa net" mentioned in the README.md and
          how to use it in a text-to-image generation. If I just activate the Lora
          in the positive prompt like &lt;<a rel="nofollow">lora:****:1</a>&gt;, the
          result will not reproduce an accurate character figure. Maybe I need some
          additional prompts or just bad luck? Could you please upload a picture of
          the character Lora with generation data for me to have a reference? Thanks
          in Advance.</p>
