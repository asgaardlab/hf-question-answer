        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>I''m recently trying to use your models on the MINDS-14 benchmark with
          XTREME-S partition scheme, while I noticed that there is this model labelled
          as "old splits" and another one (<a href="https://huggingface.co/anton-l/xtreme_s_xlsr_300m_minds14">https://huggingface.co/anton-l/xtreme_s_xlsr_300m_minds14</a>).
          May I know what''s the difference between the two models? Should I refer
          to the second model but not this one?</p>

          <p>Thank you!</p>
