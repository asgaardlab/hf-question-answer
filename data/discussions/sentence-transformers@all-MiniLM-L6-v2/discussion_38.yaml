          <p>I am computing the embeddings of sentences using the model. I store them
          so that I don''t run this computation in real time. I then get a new sentence
          in real-time, compute the embedding and want to run a sentence similarity
          between this new embedding and all others I did prior.</p>

          <p>Can this be done here?</p>
