        html: '<p>No, I don''t see any reason to re-upload.</p>

          <p>I checked the source repo and you''re right, there was an update. But
          it didn''t change the model.  Rather, they additionally uploaded the base
          model in a different format - pytorch_model.bin.  It was previously uploaded
          only in a new format, called model.safetensors.  The config.json also changed,
          but that was only because they had used a more recent version of Transformers
          to create it, so the transformers version number changed. That''s purely
          informational, and doesn''t change anything about how the model operates.</p>

          <p>I don''t know why they did the new upload in the pytorch_model.bin format,
          as that format is becoming deprecated.  But I can see that the original
          model.safetensors files are unchanged.  So the version I quantised is still
          up-to-date.</p>

          <p>I also don''t think they''d do a model update without making a new repo,
          and giving it a new name and/or version number.</p>

          <p>You can carry on using these GGUF, they''re up-to-date with the source
          Zephyr repo.</p>
