        html: '<p>Hey guys, so I am working on a little personal project which necessitates
          the use of an external AI Image generator for an output. All the public
          and famous generators I''ve seen (Hotpot.ai, Dreamstudio, e.t.c) are credit-based.
          This makes it very tough for me to actually test if my idea works without
          running out of credits, let alone actually host the website and have users
          generating pics on it. I''ve found this community and am very happy to see
          that it is so large and open-source. I''ve found some models that I think
          would be great, such as Openjourney v4 but the only issue is, I''m not actually
          sure how to use the API on my website as I haven''t seen any detailed documentation.
          The docs on huggingface about inference API seem to only be about text and
          computer vision based models. I also didn''t see much on the model cards.
          So I was wondering if anyone could point me in the right direction about
          where I can find the docs for this model or some other text-image models,
          or information about how to use these services in my project. I would be
          very grateful, Thank you!</p>

          <p>Look into diffusers library. From there on you can go ahead with integrating
          it into an api if you know what you are doing.</p>
