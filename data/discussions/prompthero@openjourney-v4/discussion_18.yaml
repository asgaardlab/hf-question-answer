        html: '<p>Hey all, </p>

          <p>I keep running into the same issue and I can''t seem to find any information
          on it. </p>

          <p>Everytime I use the Unified Canvas in InvokeAI with OpenJourney it starts
          to produce this tiled effect as seen in the bottom of the image. The first
          render works fine but when I try extending the image it always starts tiling.
          I have tried with multiple different prompts and setting but it always produces
          the same tiling results. </p>

          <p>Does Openjourney lack the ability to work with inpainting or am I missing
          something? I am new to AI and the stable diffusion world but eager to learn.
          Any help would be greatly appreciated.</p>

          <p>Im running the latest Invokeai on a Macbook pro with apple silicon if
          that helps.</p>
