        html: '<p>Hello there!</p>

          <p>Basically I''m trying to convert model to a AMD gpu compatible format,
          and repo is missing things to do that atm. Basically need to be able to
          run <code>StableDiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained(model_path, torch_dtype=dtype).to(device)</code>
          which does not work on repositories only containg .cpkt files.<br>Because
          of that, I would really appreciate if you could commit to repo all the diffusers
          related files, as you did for prompthero/openjourney, which I''ll definitely
          do a conversion of and use in the meantime.</p>

          <p>Conversion script available <a rel="nofollow" href="https://github.com/Amblyopius/AMD-Stable-Diffusion-ONNX-FP16">here</a>,
          should you want to take a look at it. Also going to mention that I did test
          V2 through Artroom in cpu mode, and while real slow results are really good.</p>

          <p>Thanks for reading me, and please keep releasing such awesome content.</p>
