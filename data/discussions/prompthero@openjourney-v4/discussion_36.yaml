        html: '<p>I''m new to SD, so forgive me if it''s a dumb question, but I was
          using this model and now see it was recently updated and <code>model_index.json</code>
          was removed. Diffusers is now complaining about the file not being found
          when I pass <code>from_pretrained(''prompthero/openjourney-v4'')</code>,
          saying the <code>model_index.json</code> is not found.<br>Is there a way
          for me to generate the file myself or does the model creator need to manage
          all of this?</p>
