        html: '<p>Hi,</p>

          <p>Apologies in advance if this is a silly question. How come that the pretrained
          nb-bert-large tokenizer use different special_tokens_ids than most other
          BERT models? </p>

          <p>nb-bert-large use: [505, 504, 503, 501, 502]<br>etc nb-bert-base use:
          [100, 102, 0, 101, 103]</p>

          <p>Furthermore, any suggestions on how to overwride the current mapping
          to the normal special_token_ids for the nb-bert-large?</p>

        html: '<p>Hi!</p>

          <p>Not silly at all. NB-BERT-base was trained by further pre-training off
          the multilingual BERT weights, which already came with its own tokenizer.
          NB-BERT-large was pre-trained from scratch and a new tokenizer was built
          for it based on a different corpus (and libraries) than the one used for
          mBERT. Hence, the discrepancy.</p>

          <p>As for the overriding, I''m not completely sure it''s possible. The base
          version as a vocab size of 119,547 (because of its multilingual nature),
          the large version of 50,000 (mostly Norwegian and Scandinavian based).</p>
