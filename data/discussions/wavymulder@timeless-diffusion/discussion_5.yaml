        html: '<p>Thank you so much!</p>

          <p>Timeless was trained on Stable Diffusion v1.5 with updated VAE. The dataset
          ended up being about 130 images, which I cropped to 1:1 and resized to 512x512.
          I trained with with a batch size of 1, LR of 1e-06 with a polynomial lr_scheduler.
          I also used prior preservation with a class dataset of 1500 images (simply
          made with the class prompt "photograph".) It was trained on a 3080ti 12GB
          w/ 8bitadam optimizer. And the checkpoint I ended up going with was 14000
          steps.</p>

          <p>Style training is really similar to character training. It all comes
          down to the dataset. People like to mess with all the training parameters,
          but imo nothing will improve your model more than improving the dataset.</p>

          <p>Hope that helps!</p>
