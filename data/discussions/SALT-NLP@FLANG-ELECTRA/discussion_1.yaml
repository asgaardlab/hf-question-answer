        html: '<p>The published paper inspired me to do ESG research for my NLP course.
          However, I find that the FLANG_ELECTRA model cannot be successfully loaded
          into PyTorch through the transformers.</p>

          <p>I find that all other models of this paper have the pickle detected for
          the "pytorch_model.bin" file, but for this model, the pickle is missing.
          I''m not sure whether this is the reason that the loading of weights failed.</p>

          <p>If anyone can successfully load this model, please let me know how you
          did it. Sincerely appreciate your help!</p>
