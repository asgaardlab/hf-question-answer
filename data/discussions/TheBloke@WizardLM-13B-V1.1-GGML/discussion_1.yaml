        html: '<p>I don''t think that helps with this model,  as 32001 is not divisible
          by 64 either. And it requires a compile-time option, so people could only
          use them if they manually re-compiled their llama.cpp or llama-cpp-python.  Also
          it degrades quality quite a lot.</p>

          <p>But today we got this PR which fixes it much more elegantly:  <a rel="nofollow"
          href="https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/2148">https://github.com/ggerganov/llama.cpp/pull/2148</a>
          .  That doesn''t require any special compilation by the user, and quality
          isn''t materially affected. File sizes will be fractionally large, but only
          by 1-2%.</p>

          <p>I will be uploading k-quants using this new method tomorrow; I don''t
          even need to wait for the PR to be merged.</p>
