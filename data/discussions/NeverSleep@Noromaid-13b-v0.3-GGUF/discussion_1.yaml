        html: '<p>This one is not it guys, i have only been testing it for like an
          hour and it forces the conversation into ERP, even when i am using physical
          brute force on the character it will try to go for ERP. It also has the
          repeating issue as many other mistral/mixtral and Yi models do. For now
          i''m going back to the 8x7b Noromaid models. Those are really good. But
          my favorite of all time is still the Amethyst 20b model. I still use that
          a lot in my non ERP characters as it really shines in violence and dark
          settings. </p>
