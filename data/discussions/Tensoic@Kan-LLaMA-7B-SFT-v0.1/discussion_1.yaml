        html: '<p>Hi Team,</p>

          <p>I''m a data science student at VIT AP, and your work on building a Kannada
          model caught my attention. I''m eager to create a large language model for
          Telugu, my mother tongue. Could you guide and support me in starting this
          process? Your help means a lot.</p>

          <p>Thank you,<br>Guna Sekhar </p>
