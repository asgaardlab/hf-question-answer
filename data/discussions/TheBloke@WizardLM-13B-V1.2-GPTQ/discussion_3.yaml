          <p>This is the same dataset I have used for all GPTQs made in the last two
          months.  It works fairly well, at least for English language models.  I
          have been thinking that I should start to use other datasets for non-English
          models, or models that are specifically for coding. I will do that in future.</p>

          <p>I am getting reports that this GPTQ is performing very poorly and I don''t
          know why.  I don''t think it''s related to the dataset, I think it''s a
          Llama 2 + GPTQ issue specifically, as I get the reports also for FreeWilly
          2 and others. It''s something I need to investigate in more detail.</p>
