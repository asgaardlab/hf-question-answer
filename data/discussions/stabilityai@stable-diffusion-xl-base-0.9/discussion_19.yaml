        html: '<p>Although... if anyone wants to school me how to best use this too,
          that''d be awesome, haha. </p>

          <p>When I tried running it, it takes in an image, and sort of does a transformation
          of it. For example, I gave it a photo of myself with a plate of food in
          front of me an prompted it to "replace the food with car parts". It transformed
          the image, but nothing really changed, but everything was kind of messed
          up. Different person, food on my shirt for some reason, all kind of blurry,
          no car parts. </p>

          <p>I was hoping to be able to do things like... replace backgrounds, take
          my face and put it on other characters, replace items in photos. Is that
          not what this pipeline is for? I''ve seen examples of taking a sketch and
          transforming it into a "good" drawing. Is the img2img model just sort of...
          minimizing the given input photo to whatever it knows as a good solution,
          without regard to the original aesthetics of the image? Could someone who
          knows better explain what this particular pipeline is best at doing and
          how it may be doing it? </p>

          <p>Thanks for all the help!</p>
