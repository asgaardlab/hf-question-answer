          <p>There''s a catch, though: Overly long or complicated prompts are unlikely

          or any of the varieties similar techniques if you need finer control.</p>

          <p>Supposedly there would be official releases of some of those soon enough.
          Some of those are already deployed on Clipdrop.</p>
