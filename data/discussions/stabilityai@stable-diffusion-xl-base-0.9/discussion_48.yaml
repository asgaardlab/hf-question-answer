        html: '<p>So did a fresh install with Auto and SDXL. If I run the WEBui bat
          and wait 10 seconds. It''s loaded. But any thing I try to generate just
          says "in queue" forever. However if I run the bat and leave my PC for about
          30 minutes, when I come back, then I can run Auto fine and images generate.</p>

          <p>My only other issue is if I do anything to big, it says I have not enough
          VRAM then seems to stop me from create anything other images unless I run
          the bat file again. I only have 8ram on my 2070 Super. Though my system
          have 64g ram </p>
