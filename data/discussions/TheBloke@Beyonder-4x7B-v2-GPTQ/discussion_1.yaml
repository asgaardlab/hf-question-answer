        html: '<p>The card in your quant says ChatML, and the original model itself
          makes no mention of it. However, taking a look at the collab notebook:</p>

          <p><a rel="nofollow" href="https://cdn-uploads.huggingface.co/production/uploads/6550f6513a42dbfb4b312ed9/YwIsRRp3JaKy6TEb8CTWr.png"><img

          <p>I do see [INST] there, together with &lt; &lt; SYS &gt; &gt; &lt; &lt;/
          SYS&gt; &gt; which I personally didn''t know. </p>

          <p>So I''m not sure. I''ve used my mistral template to compare with chatML
          and it does seem to perform better, but then again it might be confirmation
          bias.</p>
