        html: '<p>Hi Judi!</p>

          <p>I am trying to erase any reference to know artist and build my own reference
          structure. </p>

          <p>As you can see in my prompt, V2 still has dependencies but V3 is getting
          much more independent. It''s not easy as the current SD 1.5 model had a
          lot of concept spilling. I didn''t manage to get a pipeline working for
          2.1. As I understood, a lot of artist were remove from 2.1, which I hope
          will make it a much better baseline to train my style.</p>

          <p>In my case I used Unreal Engine to produce various landscape and style
          as well as other pipeline like MidJourney to tweak some close-up. Ultimately
          I hope to rely purely on Unreal Engine as I can generate and automated a
          vast amount of images. Using Unreal to teach the AI is incredibly powerful
          for landscape, light and perspective. It is also good for some fabrics,
          but it get much time consuming when you get face, hair, etc.. That''s where
          I get MidJourney to bridge some gap. The original starting point was a merged
          pack plus very general training.</p>

          <p>With V3 I now have more than 4000 images and 300 000 steps. The training
          process is broken down in small iterations (ex: leather armor) that hold
          50 images with 3k to 5k steps. I train 10 concepts at a time (using the
          json concept file) and make various control image to see if the model is
          overtrained. I reproduce this cycle for other components (heavy armor, thief
          rogue, etc...) or I do a 2nd run on existing concept that did not train
          enough. </p>

          <p>Because of that I tend to keep the training rate low and do more steps.
          That being said, it is still very rudimentary. I may end-up with a model
          that can only produce a too limited range. But yesterday we did a stream
          and try to see if my model could improve the style of other''s work; in
          this case cyberpunk art and pencil art of old western drawing. Surprisingly,
          it did improve a lot both style, specifically impacted the quality of the
          clothing details. So when V3 is out, I do invite people to take their current
          model and merge it (at 0.3 weight) with V3 to see if it''s improve their
          pipeline.</p>

          <p>Anyway, feel free to ask more questions!! :)</p>
