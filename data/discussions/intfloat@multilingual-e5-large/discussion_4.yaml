        html: '<p>Thanks for taking the time to reply! I understand if that decision
          has been finalized but I think there are even out-of-the-box use cases for
          the unsupervised model. Performance in languages not covered in the fine-tuning
          dataset is spotty - it''s conceivable to me that the pre-trained model might
          perform better, out-of-the-box, in these languages. Just a consideration
          and thanks again for all the releases so far!</p>
