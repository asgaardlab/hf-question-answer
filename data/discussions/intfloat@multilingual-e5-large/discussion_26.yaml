          <p>In your paper, you suggest fine-tuning with MS-Marco and NQ formats.
          However, I use document pairs with annotated cosine similarity scores.</p>

          <p>Is that format okay, or should I look into something else for generating
          rich embeddings?</p>

          <p>Also, my domain is kind of special, and labeled data is difficult to
          obtain, but I have a few million unlabeled domain-specific sentences.</p>

          <p>Is there some unsupervised pretraining/finetuning you can suggest?</p>
