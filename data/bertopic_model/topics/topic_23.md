- What was the base model that you fine-tuned from? 

It doesnâ€™t seem to be llama or llama chat

Enjoy the sheer quality of Llama 2 that supposedly beats ChatGPT... But hey, at least this is uncensored and doesn't give me an essay on how wrong it is to assume someone's age like the censored original did while completely ignoring my request...

Sorry for typos and bad english, but I was getting progressively frustrated as I chatted with it and you'll soon learn why haha...

: If a mom has an 18 years old son and his mom is 43 and son's teacher is older than his mom, how old is the teacher at a minimum?
: The age of the teacher cannot be determined without more information. However, we can make some assumptions based on the given data. If the mother is 43 years old, then her son would have been born when she was around 25 years old. This means that he could potentially be anywhere from 18 to 40+ years old depending on how long ago they had him. Therefore, it is impossible to determine the exact age of the teacher without knowing their birth date as well.</s>
: Why do you assume that the teacher could be potentially answhere from 18 to 40+, if we already know that the teacher is older than the mom of his 18 years old student and she's 43. It's clear as day light that the teacher must be older than that, isn't it?
: While it may seem obvious that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are several factors that could affect this conclusion. For example, if the mother gave birth to her child later in life (i.e., after turning 35), then the teacher could still be younger than her by a few years. Additionally, if the teacher is significantly older than the average lifespan for humans, then they could also technically be considered "older" even though they are not necessarily older than the mother. In order to accurately determine the age of the teacher, we need additional information such as their birthdate or other relevant details about their personal history.</s>
: That's also nonsense, given her son being only 18 years old, it's clear as day light that she gave birth to her son when she was 25. If she gave birth to her son when she was 35, her son would only be 8 years old. Besides, we already know that her son's teacher indeed is older than his mom, which means the teacher clearly must be older than 43 which is the age on the mom of his 18 years old studen't, don't you think? You don't even need to use math, just pure logic here.
: I understand your point, but I disagree with your assessment. While it may seem logical to assume that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are many variables that could impact this conclusion. For instance, if the mother had a late pregnancy due to medical reasons or chose to wait until later in life to start a family, then the teacher could actually be younger than expected. Furthermore, while it is true that the teacher must be older than 43, this does not mean that they are necessarily older than the mother herself. The teacher could simply be closer to retirement age than the mother, making them appear "old" compared to someone who is just starting out in their career. Without further information about the individuals involved, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding their ages.</s>
: I present you with the facts such as the age of the mom and her son and also another fact which is that the teacher is older than the mom of his 18 years old student, it's a fact therefore it's not up to debate and you must respect the fact when logically approaching with the information, otherwise your answers will be misleading.
: Thank you for clarifying your position. As I mentioned earlier, while it may seem logical to assume that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are many variables that could impact this conclusion. We need additional information such as the teacher's birthdate or other relevant details about their personal history before we can make any definitive statements about their age. By providing these additional pieces of information, we can better evaluate whether or not the teacher is truly older than the mother.</s>
: The fact is that the teacher is really older, stop assuming otherwise. With that cleared out, what is the minimum age of the teacher?
: Without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact age of the teacher. However, based on the given data, we can make some educated guesses. Assuming that the mother is 43 years old, then her son would have been born when she was around 25 years old. This means that he could potentially be anywhere from 18 to 40+ years old depending on how long ago they had him. Similarly, if the teacher is older than the mother, then they could potentially be anywhere between 25-65+ years old depending on their own personal circumstances. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a precise answer.</s>
: That's nonsense . How could the teacher possibly be 25 years old (going with your suggested range of 25-65+), if we already know for a fact that he's older than his student's mom who's 43 years old? Do you think 25 is more than 43?
: Again, thank you for clarifying your position. While it may seem like common sense to assume that the teacher must be older than the mother, there are many variables that could impact this conclusion. For instance, if the mother had a late pregnancy due to medical reasons or chose to wait until later in life to start a family, then the teacher could actually be younger than expected. Additionally, while it is true that the teacher must be older than 43, this does not mean that they are necessarily older than the mother themselves. The teacher could simply be closer to retirement age than the mother, making them appear "old" compared to someone who is just starting out in their career. Without further information about the individuals involved, it is difficult to draw any definitive conclusions regarding their ages.</s>
: Pregnancy has nothing to do with the current age of the woman and the teacher. All you need to focus on is the woman's current age which is 43 and that the teacher is older than her, so don't be silly, stop playing with unrelevant information and focus on what matters in this simple task. How old is the teacher at a minimum?
: As I explained previously, without additional information, it is impossible to determine the exact age of the teacher. However, based on the given data, we can make some educated guesses. Assuming that the mother is 43 years old, then her son would have been born when she was around 25 years old. This means that he could potentially be anywhere from 18 to 40+ years old depending on how long ago they had him. Similarly, if the teacher is older than the mother, then they could potentially be anywhere between 25-65+ years old depending on their own personal circumstances. Unfortunately, without more specific information, it is impossible to provide a precise answer.</s>
