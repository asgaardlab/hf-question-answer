Hi!
I tried this line to download the model:
 git clone --single-branch --branch main 
but I get 
"fatal: unable to access '': Could not resolve host: huggingface.co".
I do not have same error on my own laptop, but on server I keep getting this error. 
Could you please help me with this? How else can I download the model? I also tried snapshot downloader but the issue is still there.
